# Paper 4 Progress: The Molecular Basis of τ

## Completed Sessions
* **Phase 1, Day 1 (Literature Review — Decomposing τ)** [2024-05-14]: Completed. Decomposed the total proprioceptive delay ($\tau$) into its constituent components (peripheral transduction, afferent conduction, spinal relay, cerebellar processing, efferent conduction, NMJ, and electromechanical delay). Identified initial molecular targets for each component. Incorporated PIEZO2 human mechanosensation literature (Chesler et al., 2016, DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1602812) and EMD values (Hopkins et al., 2009, DOI: 10.1002/jor.20934). Explicitly flagged numerical latency estimates requiring specific human paraspinal confirmation. Output generated in `paper4_literature/day1_tau_decomposition.md`.
* **Phase 1, Day 2 (Literature Review — AIS genetics)**: Completed. Reviewed GWAS hits for AIS, including LBX1, GPR126, and PAX1. Extracted risk alleles, effect sizes, population frequencies, and proposed biological functions where available in literature. Missing values were explicitly flagged as 'unverified — needs literature confirmation'. Mapped these genes to specific components of the proprioceptive delay $\tau$. Output generated in `paper4_literature/day2_ais_gwas.md`.

## Key Findings/Decisions Made
* The total proprioceptive delay can be precisely modeled as a sum of 7 distinct physiological steps.
* Key molecular targets map cleanly onto different components: e.g., Piezo2 handles transduction ($\tau_{trans}$), GPR126 handles afferent conduction ($\tau_{aff}$), LBX1 handles spinal relay ($\tau_{spin}$).
* Most precise latency values in human electrophysiology literature are derived from appendicular (limb) muscles. Exact paraspinal values remain sparse and are flagged as "unverified — needs literature confirmation".
* LBX1 variants (e.g. rs11190878) have an OR of ~1.56 for the risk haplotype and map to spinal relay delay.
* GPR126 variants (e.g. rs6570507) have an OR of ~1.28 and map to afferent conduction delay due to its role in myelination.
* PAX1 variants may influence the plant mechanics (vertebral geometry) rather than the proprioceptive controller itself.

## Issues / Questions for Dr. Sayuj
* Does Dr. Sayuj prefer to focus strictly on long-loop (transcortical/cerebellar) postural reflexes for the total $\tau$ budget (~100-200ms), or should we also model short-loop (spinal) stretch reflexes (~30-50ms) as a secondary control loop? The current decomposition applies to both, but $\tau_{cereb}$ is the dominant term for postural control.

## Next Session
* **Phase 1, Day 3**: GPR126 deep dive — role in Schwann cell myelination, peripheral nerve development, knockout phenotypes, any conduction velocity data. Search for AlphaFold structure and AIS variant mapping. Output to `paper4_literature/day3_gpr126.md`.
