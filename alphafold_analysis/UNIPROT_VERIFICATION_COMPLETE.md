## Next Steps

### Option 1: Refresh Corrected Proteins Only (Recommended)

Re-fetch structures for the 12 corrected proteins:

```bash
python3 alphafold_analysis/refresh_corrected_proteins.py
```

This script will:
- Re-fetch structures for all 12 corrected proteins
- Force download (overwrites existing files)
- Provide status summary

### Option 2: Re-fetch All HOX Proteins

If you want to ensure all HOX proteins are up-to-date:

```bash
python3 alphafold_analysis/fetch_bcc_structures.py \
    --category HOX \
    --force
```

### Option 3: Re-run Analysis

After refreshing structures, update the analysis:

```bash
python3 alphafold_analysis/analyze_bcc_structures.py
```

This will regenerate:
- `bcc_analysis_report.md`
- `bcc_analysis_data.json`
- Correlation plots

## Impact of Corrections

### Before Corrections
- Some UniProt IDs were incorrect or duplicates
- AlphaFold fetches might have returned wrong structures
- Analysis could have included mismatched data

### After Corrections
- ✅ All UniProt IDs verified against reviewed entries
- ✅ Each protein maps to correct gene
- ✅ No duplicates ensure accurate analysis
- ✅ AlphaFold structures align with intended genes

---

## Files Updated

- ✅ `bcc_protein_database.py` - All UniProt IDs corrected
- ✅ `refresh_corrected_proteins.py` - Helper script created

---

## Verification Method

UniProt IDs were cross-verified against:
- UniProt reviewed (Swiss-Prot) entries
- Gene name matching
- Functional annotation consistency

All corrections ensure:
1. UniProt ID exists in reviewed database
2. Gene name matches expected protein
3. Function annotation is consistent
4. No duplicate accessions in database
