**Subject**: Submission of "Biological Countercurvature of Spacetime: A Unified Framework for Spinal Curvature and Scoliosis"

Dear Editors,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript "Biological Countercurvature of Spacetime: A Unified Framework for Spinal Curvature and Scoliosis" for consideration for publication in PRX Life.

**Why PRX Life?** Our work bridges physics, biomechanics, and information theory, using an analog-gravity framework to unify normal and pathological spinal curvature. PRX Life's focus on interdisciplinary physics applied to living systems makes it an ideal venue for this work.

**Key contributions:**

1. **Unified framework**: We show that normal sagittal spinal curvature and scoliosis-like lateral deviations emerge from a single Information-Elasticity Coupling (IEC) model operating in different countercurvature regimes, providing a quantitative language for how biological information reshapes equilibrium geometry.

2. **Quantitative predictions**: Using a Riemannian metric derived from information fields, we construct a phase diagram in (χ_κ, g) space that cleanly separates gravity-dominated, cooperative, and information-dominated regimes. In the information-dominated regime, small thoracic asymmetries (5%) are amplified into scoliosis-like branches (S_lat ≥ 0.05, Cobb-like angles >10°), while the same perturbation produces negligible deviation in the gravity-dominated regime.

3. **Microgravity persistence**: We demonstrate that information-driven structure (quantified by normalized geodesic curvature deviation D̂_geo) persists independently of gravitational loading: as g decreases from 1.0 to 0.01, passive curvature energy falls by [X]%, while D̂_geo changes by only [Y]%, providing quantitative evidence for "biological countercurvature."

4. **Experimental testability**: The framework makes sharp, testable predictions for microgravity posture studies, scoliosis progression data, and in vivo spinal curvature measurements, bridging theoretical physics and clinical biomechanics.

**Novelty and significance:** While previous work has modeled spinal curvature using mechanical or neural control frameworks, our approach is the first to treat information processing as a source of effective metric modification in an analog-gravity setting. This provides a unified perspective on normal and pathological curvature, with concrete quantitative predictions that can be tested experimentally.

**Data availability:** All code, simulation outputs, and figure generation scripts are available in our GitHub repository [URL], ensuring full reproducibility.

We believe this work will be of broad interest to the PRX Life readership, spanning physics, biomechanics, and information theory communities. We look forward to your consideration.

Sincerely,

## For Nature Communications

**Subject**: Submission of "Biological Countercurvature: Information-Driven Geometry in Living Systems"

Dear Editors,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript "Biological Countercurvature: Information-Driven Geometry in Living Systems" for consideration for publication in Nature Communications.

**Why Nature Communications?** Our work provides a quantitative framework that unifies normal and pathological spinal curvature through an analog-gravity model, with direct implications for understanding how biological information processing reshapes body geometry. The interdisciplinary nature of this work—bridging physics, biomechanics, and information theory—aligns with Nature Communications' mission to publish research of broad interest across scientific disciplines.

**Key contributions:**

1. **Unified framework for spinal curvature**: We demonstrate that normal S-shaped spinal profiles and scoliosis-like lateral deviations emerge from a single Information-Elasticity Coupling (IEC) model operating in different countercurvature regimes. This provides a quantitative language for how biological information can stabilize, redirect, or destabilize the shapes that gravity alone would select.

2. **Quantitative phase diagram**: Using a Riemannian metric derived from information fields, we construct a phase diagram in (χ_κ, g) space that identifies three distinct regimes: gravity-dominated (D̂_geo_norm < 0.1), cooperative (0.1 ≤ D̂_geo_norm ≤ 0.3), and information-dominated (D̂_geo_norm > 0.3). In the information-dominated regime, small thoracic asymmetries (5%) are amplified into scoliosis-like branches (Cobb-like angles >10°), while the same perturbation produces negligible deviation in the gravity-dominated regime.

3. **Microgravity predictions**: We show that information-driven structure persists independently of gravitational loading: as g decreases from 1.0 to 0.01, passive curvature energy falls by [X]%, while normalized geodesic curvature deviation D̂_geo changes by only [Y]%. This provides quantitative evidence for "biological countercurvature" and makes testable predictions for microgravity posture studies.

4. **Clinical relevance**: The framework offers a unified perspective on normal and pathological spinal geometry, with concrete quantitative predictions that could inform scoliosis screening, progression monitoring, and microgravity adaptation studies.

**Novelty and significance:** This is the first work to treat biological information processing as a source of effective metric modification in an analog-gravity setting, providing a quantitative bridge between mechanical simulations, information fields, and Riemannian geometry. The framework makes sharp, testable predictions that can be validated against experimental data, bridging theoretical physics and clinical biomechanics.

**Data availability:** All code, simulation outputs, and figure generation scripts are available in our GitHub repository [URL], ensuring full reproducibility and enabling the research community to build upon this work.

We believe this work will be of broad interest to the Nature Communications readership, spanning physics, biomechanics, neuroscience, and clinical research communities. We look forward to your consideration.

Sincerely,
