\section{Conclusions}

We have presented a unified theoretical framework for \emph{Biological Countercurvature}, demonstrating that the geometry of the spine is an active, information-driven solution to the problem of upright posture in gravity. By bridging the scales from molecular genetics (AlphaFold-derived stiffness and chirality parameters) to macroscopic continuum mechanics (Cosserat rod theory), we have shown that the S-curve emerges as a specific, gravity-selected eigenmode of the system.

This framework redefines our understanding of spinal pathology: idiopathic scoliosis is neither a simple mechanical buckling nor a purely genetic accident, but a "decoding error" where the spine falls into an unstable, high-energy mode due to information-elasticity mismatch. Ultimately, this work suggests that biological form is not merely shaped by forces, but by the \textit{information} that directs matter to resist them.
