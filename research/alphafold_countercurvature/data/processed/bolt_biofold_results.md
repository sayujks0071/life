## 3. Interpretation
**Family: seed_ECM**
- **COL11A2**: COL11A2: Anisotropy=2.5, pLDDT=49. Intermediate shape. Warning: Low confidence structure. Detected 24 potential flexible hinges; may act as mechanical sensor/switch. (Conf: Low). Test: Mutate hinge region to test effect on mechanosensitivity.

**Family: seed_Mechanosensors**
- **PIEZO2**: PIEZO2: Anisotropy=4.4, pLDDT=79. Highly extended/fibrous.  Rigid rod-like geometry suggests load-bearing capacity or long-range connectivity. (Conf: Medium). Test: Verify fiber formation in vivo; test mechanical stiffness.

**Family: seed_Scoliosis_Drivers**
- **ADGRG6**: ADGRG6: Anisotropy=3.1, pLDDT=74. Highly extended/fibrous.  Rigid rod-like geometry suggests load-bearing capacity or long-range connectivity. (Conf: Medium). Test: Mutate hinge region to test effect on mechanosensitivity.
- **LBX1**: LBX1: Anisotropy=2.3, pLDDT=67. Intermediate shape. Warning: Low confidence structure. Standard globular domain, likely biochemical role or node in network. (Conf: Low). Test: Check expression timing relative to spine straightening.
- **POC5**: POC5: Anisotropy=24.7, pLDDT=64. Highly extended/fibrous. Warning: Low confidence structure. Detected 5 potential flexible hinges; may act as mechanical sensor/switch. (Conf: Low). Test: Verify fiber formation in vivo; test mechanical stiffness.
- **PTK7**: PTK7: Anisotropy=7.4, pLDDT=83. Highly extended/fibrous.  Rigid rod-like geometry suggests load-bearing capacity or long-range connectivity. (Conf: Medium). Test: Verify fiber formation in vivo; test mechanical stiffness.

**Family: seed_Segmentation**
- **HES7**: HES7: Anisotropy=2.2, pLDDT=73. Intermediate shape.  Standard globular domain, likely biochemical role or node in network. (Conf: Medium). Test: Check expression timing relative to spine straightening.
- **MESP2**: MESP2: Anisotropy=4.0, pLDDT=54. Highly extended/fibrous. Warning: Low confidence structure. Detected 1 potential flexible hinges; may act as mechanical sensor/switch. (Conf: Low). Test: Verify fiber formation in vivo; test mechanical stiffness.
