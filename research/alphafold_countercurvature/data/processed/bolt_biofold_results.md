## 3. Interpretation
**Family: Cilia**
- **KIF3A**: KIF3A: Anisotropy=2.9, pLDDT=75. Intermediate shape.  Detected 4 potential flexible hinges; may act as mechanical sensor/switch. (Conf: Medium). Test: Mutate hinge region to test effect on mechanosensitivity.

**Family: ECM**
- **COL12A1**: COL12A1: Anisotropy=4.1, pLDDT=76. Highly extended/fibrous.  Rigid rod-like geometry suggests load-bearing capacity or long-range connectivity. (Conf: Medium). Test: Verify fiber formation in vivo; test mechanical stiffness.

**Family: Mechanotransduction**
- **PIEZO2**: PIEZO2: Anisotropy=4.4, pLDDT=79. Highly extended/fibrous.  Rigid rod-like geometry suggests load-bearing capacity or long-range connectivity. (Conf: Medium). Test: Verify fiber formation in vivo; test mechanical stiffness.

**Family: Nucleus**
- **LMNA**: LMNA: Anisotropy=4.8, pLDDT=76. Highly extended/fibrous.  Rigid rod-like geometry suggests load-bearing capacity or long-range connectivity. (Conf: Medium). Test: Verify fiber formation in vivo; test mechanical stiffness.

**Family: Proprioception**
- **LBX1**: LBX1: Anisotropy=2.3, pLDDT=67. Intermediate shape. Warning: Low confidence structure. Standard globular domain, likely biochemical role or node in network. (Conf: Low). Test: Check expression timing relative to spine straightening.
