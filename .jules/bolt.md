## 2026-01-23 - [SASA with cKDTree]

**Learning:** Calculating exposed surface proxy (SASA) using manual block-based neighbor search is slow ((N^2)$ worst case) and CPU-intensive for large proteins.

**Action:** Replaced the manual implementation with `scipy.spatial.cKDTree` when available. This reduces the neighbor search complexity to (N \log N)$, yielding a ~20x speedup for 5000-residue proteins (0.5s -> 0.02s per structure) while maintaining exact results.

## 2026-07-17 - [DataFrame Lookup vs Dict Lookup]

**Learning:** Looking up candidate metadata using pandas filtering (`df[df['col'] == val]`) inside a loop over N structures is O(M) per iteration (where M is candidates count). For N=20,000 and growing M, this dominates runtime.

**Action:** Pre-indexed the `candidates` DataFrame into a dictionary (`gene -> {info}`) before the loop. This reduces lookup from O(M) to O(1), yielding a ~6000x speedup for the lookup operation alone and ensuring the pipeline scales linearly with N, not N*M.

## 2026-07-28 - [Vectorized PAE Metrics]

**Learning:** `calculate_pae_metrics` used a nested loop over segments ($O(S^2)$) to compute block means. For proteins with many domains (e.g., 20+), the Python loop overhead became significant. Naive usage of `np.add.reduceat` on the full matrix is slow for sparse segments because it processes the gaps.

**Action:** Implemented a "compact matrix" approach: extract high-confidence rows/cols into a smaller contiguous matrix, then use `np.add.reduceat` to compute all block sums in $O(1)$ Python calls (vectorized). This yields a 16x speedup for 100-domain structures (1.32s -> 0.08s) and 2.5x for sparse structures, while preserving exact results.

## 2026-07-30 - [Torsion Norm Reuse]

**Learning:** `calculate_torsion` computed `np.linalg.norm` on `normals` twice (for overlapping `n1` and `n2` arrays), causing redundant `sqrt` and `sum` operations (~50% overhead for norms).

**Action:** Compute norms of `normals` once for the whole array, then slice to get `n1_norm` and `n2_norm`. This yielded a ~15% speedup for the `calculate_torsion` function (1.28ms -> 1.09ms per structure) and reduces CPU cycles for geometry calculations.

## 2026-01-26 - [Geometry Precomputation]

**Learning:** Curvature calculation used Heron's formula (requiring `sqrt`), and Torsion calculation computed cross-products and norms separately. These operations were redundant because the Torsion cross-product norm is exactly twice the triangle Area used in Curvature.

**Action:** Hoisted cross-product and norm calculations to `analyze_structure` and passed them to both functions. Used `0.5 * norm` for Area (skipping Heron's formula) and reused the precomputed arrays for Torsion. This yielded a ~17% speedup for the total metric analysis time (46ms -> 38ms per structure).
