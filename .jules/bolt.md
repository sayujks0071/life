## 2026-01-23 - [SASA with cKDTree]

**Learning:** Calculating exposed surface proxy (SASA) using manual block-based neighbor search is slow ((N^2)$ worst case) and CPU-intensive for large proteins.

**Action:** Replaced the manual implementation with `scipy.spatial.cKDTree` when available. This reduces the neighbor search complexity to (N \log N)$, yielding a ~20x speedup for 5000-residue proteins (0.5s -> 0.02s per structure) while maintaining exact results.

## 2026-07-17 - [DataFrame Lookup vs Dict Lookup]

**Learning:** Looking up candidate metadata using pandas filtering (`df[df['col'] == val]`) inside a loop over N structures is O(M) per iteration (where M is candidates count). For N=20,000 and growing M, this dominates runtime.

**Action:** Pre-indexed the `candidates` DataFrame into a dictionary (`gene -> {info}`) before the loop. This reduces lookup from O(M) to O(1), yielding a ~6000x speedup for the lookup operation alone and ensuring the pipeline scales linearly with N, not N*M.

## 2026-07-28 - [Vectorized PAE Metrics]

**Learning:** `calculate_pae_metrics` used a nested loop over segments ($O(S^2)$) to compute block means. For proteins with many domains (e.g., 20+), the Python loop overhead became significant. Naive usage of `np.add.reduceat` on the full matrix is slow for sparse segments because it processes the gaps.

**Action:** Implemented a "compact matrix" approach: extract high-confidence rows/cols into a smaller contiguous matrix, then use `np.add.reduceat` to compute all block sums in $O(1)$ Python calls (vectorized). This yields a 16x speedup for 100-domain structures (1.32s -> 0.08s) and 2.5x for sparse structures, while preserving exact results.

## 2026-07-30 - [Torsion Norm Reuse]

**Learning:** `calculate_torsion` computed `np.linalg.norm` on `normals` twice (for overlapping `n1` and `n2` arrays), causing redundant `sqrt` and `sum` operations (~50% overhead for norms).

**Action:** Compute norms of `normals` once for the whole array, then slice to get `n1_norm` and `n2_norm`. This yielded a ~15% speedup for the `calculate_torsion` function (1.28ms -> 1.09ms per structure) and reduces CPU cycles for geometry calculations.

## 2026-08-05 - [Geometry Reuse: Area via Normals]

**Learning:** `calculate_curvature` used Heron's formula (expensive `sqrt` and arithmetic on side lengths) while `calculate_torsion` independently computed cross products. The triangle area needed for curvature is exactly $0.5 \times \|\text{CrossProduct}\|$. Recomputing these separately is wasteful.

**Action:** Refactored `analyze_structure` to precompute `normals` (cross products) and `normals_norm` once. Passed these to both functions. `calculate_curvature` now uses `0.5 * normals_norm` (skipping Heron's entirely), and `calculate_torsion` reuses the precomputed arrays. Benchmarks show 1.29x speedup for curvature and 2.12x for torsion (logic only), with verified identical results.

## 2026-08-06 - [Uncompressed Coordinate Cache]

**Learning:** `np.savez_compressed` adds significant CPU overhead (~3ms per file) when saving small arrays like PDB coordinates (N x 3 floats), with negligible disk space savings compared to uncompressed `np.savez`. For 20k+ structures, this adds up.

**Action:** Switched to `np.savez` (uncompressed) for coordinate caches in `StructureParser`. This yields a ~3x speedup in writing and ~1.7x in reading these specific caches. Loading remains compatible with legacy compressed files.

## 2026-08-07 - [Optimized PDB Line Checks]

**Learning:** Parsing PDB files involves iterating over thousands of lines. The standard idiom `line[12:16].strip() == 'CA'` creates a new string object and calls a method for *every* line (40k+ lines for 5000 residues), even though only ~1/8th are CA atoms. This string manipulation dominates the inner loop.

**Action:** Replaced the string slice and method call with a direct index-based check: `line[13]=='C' and line[14]=='A'`. Included safety checks for line length and spacing. Benchmarks show a ~1.18x speedup (18%) for the parsing phase, reducing the cost of processing new PDB files significantly without altering behavior.
