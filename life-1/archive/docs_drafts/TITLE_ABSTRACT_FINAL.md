**Biological Countercurvature of Spacetime: An Information--Cosserat Framework for Spinal Geometry**

---

## Current Abstract

Living systems routinely generate and maintain structure against gravity, from plant stems that grow upward to vertebrate spines that adopt robust S-shaped profiles. Here we develop a quantitative framework in which such behavior is interpreted as *biological countercurvature*: information-driven modification of the effective geometry experienced by a body in a gravitational field. We combine an information--elasticity coupling (IEC) model of spinal patterning with three-dimensional Cosserat rod mechanics implemented in PyElastica, treating the rod in gravity as an analog spacetime and the IEC information field I(s) as a source of effective countercurvature.

On the body axis s, we define a biological metric dℓ_eff² = g_eff(s) ds², where the conformal factor g_eff(s) depends on the local amplitude and gradient of I(s). Using this countercurvature metric, we introduce a normalized geodesic curvature deviation D̂_geo that measures how far information-shaped equilibrium curvature profiles depart from the corresponding gravity-selected profiles. Across canonical simulations---human-like spinal S-curves, plant-like stems, and microgravity adaptation---we show that D̂_geo cleanly separates gravity-dominated, cooperative, and information-dominated regimes in (χ_κ, g) space, where χ_κ controls information-to-curvature coupling and g denotes gravitational strength.

To probe pathology within the same framework, we introduce a small, localized thoracic asymmetry in the information field or lateral rest curvature and track coronal-plane deformations. In the gravity-dominated regime, this perturbation produces negligible lateral deviation. In contrast, in the information-dominated corner of the phase diagram (at stronger coupling than explored in our current sweep), the same small asymmetry is predicted to be amplified into a scoliosis-like symmetry-broken branch, characterized by increased lateral displacement and Cobb-like angles together with large D̂_geo. These results suggest that normal sagittal curvature and scoliosis-like patterns can emerge from a single IEC--Cosserat model operating in different countercurvature regimes, providing an analog-gravity perspective on how biological information reshapes equilibrium geometry in a gravitational field.
