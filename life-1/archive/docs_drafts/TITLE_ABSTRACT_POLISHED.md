## Polished Abstract

Living systems routinely generate and maintain structure against gravity, from plant stems that grow upward to vertebrate spines that adopt robust S-shaped profiles. Here we develop a quantitative framework in which such behavior is interpreted as *biological countercurvature*: information-driven modification of the effective geometry experienced by a body in a gravitational field. We combine an information--elasticity coupling (IEC) model of spinal patterning with three-dimensional Cosserat rod mechanics implemented in PyElastica, treating the rod in gravity as an analog spacetime and the IEC information field $I(s)$ as a source of effective countercurvature.

On the body axis $s$, we define a biological metric $d\ell_{\mathrm{eff}}^{2} = g_{\mathrm{eff}}(s)\,ds^{2}$, where the conformal factor $g_{\mathrm{eff}}(s)$ depends on the local amplitude and gradient of $I(s)$. Using this countercurvature metric, we introduce a normalized geodesic curvature deviation $\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}}$ that measures how far information-shaped equilibrium curvature profiles depart from the corresponding gravity-selected profiles. Across canonical simulations---human-like spinal S-curves, plant-like stems, and microgravity adaptation---we show that $\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}}$ cleanly separates gravity-dominated, cooperative, and information-dominated regimes in $(\chi_{\kappa}, g)$ space, where $\chi_{\kappa}$ controls information-to-curvature coupling and $g$ denotes gravitational strength.

To probe pathology within the same framework, we introduce a small, localized thoracic asymmetry in the information field or lateral rest curvature and track coronal-plane deformations. In the gravity-dominated regime, this perturbation produces negligible lateral deviation. In contrast, in the information-dominated corner of the phase diagram (at stronger coupling than explored in our current sweep), the same small asymmetry is predicted to be amplified into a scoliosis-like symmetry-broken branch, characterized by increased lateral displacement and Cobb-like angles together with large $\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}}$. These results suggest that normal sagittal curvature and scoliosis-like patterns can emerge from a single IEC--Cosserat model operating in different countercurvature regimes, providing an analog-gravity perspective on how biological information reshapes equilibrium geometry in a gravitational field.

## Minimal Polish Suggestions

The abstract is already strong. Here are three tiny tweaks for maximum clarity:

### Option 1: Slightly tighter opening (optional)

**Current:** "Living systems routinely generate and maintain structure against gravity, from plant stems that grow upward to vertebrate spines that adopt robust S-shaped profiles."

**Alternative (slightly tighter):** "Living systems routinely generate and maintain structure against gravity---from plant stems that grow upward to vertebrate spines that adopt robust S-shaped profiles."

*(Just changing comma to em-dash for slightly better flow; current version is fine)*

### Option 2: Clarify "canonical simulations" (optional)

**Current:** "Across canonical simulations---human-like spinal S-curves, plant-like stems, and microgravity adaptation---"

**Alternative:** "Across three canonical simulations---human-like spinal S-curves, plant-like stems, and microgravity adaptation---"

*(Adds specificity; current version is also fine)*

### Option 3: No changes needed

The abstract is already clear, precise, and well-structured. All three paragraphs flow logically, and the scientific content is accurately represented. The conservative wording about the scoliotic regime is appropriate.

## Recommendation

**Keep the abstract as-is.** It's already polished, clear, and appropriate for PRX Life. The three suggestions above are truly minimal and optional; the current version reads well and accurately represents the work.
