# Abstract: Biological Countercurvature of Spacetime

## Draft Abstract (250-300 words)

Living systems routinely generate and maintain structure against gravity, from plant stems that grow upward to vertebrate spines that adopt robust S-shaped profiles. Here we develop a quantitative framework in which such behaviour is interpreted as **biological countercurvature**: information-driven modification of the effective geometry experienced by a body in a gravitational field. We combine an information–elasticity coupling (IEC) model of spinal patterning with three-dimensional Cosserat rod mechanics implemented in PyElastica, treating the rod in gravity as an analog spacetime and the IEC information field (I(s)) as a source of effective countercurvature.

On the body axis (s), we define a biological metric (d\ell_{\mathrm{eff}}^{2} = g_{\mathrm{eff}}(s) \cdot ds^{2}), where the conformal factor (g_{\mathrm{eff}}(s)) depends on the local amplitude and gradient of (I(s)). Using this countercurvature metric, we introduce a normalized geodesic curvature deviation (\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}}) that measures how far information-shaped equilibrium curvature profiles depart from the corresponding gravity-selected profiles. Across a set of canonical simulations—human-like spinal S-curves, plant-like stems, and microgravity adaptation—we show that (\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}}) cleanly separates gravity-dominated, cooperative, and information-dominated regimes in ((\chi_\kappa, g)) space, where (\chi_\kappa) controls information-to-curvature coupling and (g) denotes gravitational strength.

To probe pathology within the same framework, we introduce a small, localized thoracic asymmetry in the information field or lateral rest curvature and track coronal-plane deformations. In the gravity-dominated regime, this perturbation produces negligible lateral deviation. In contrast, in the information-dominated corner of the phase diagram, the same small asymmetry is amplified into a scoliosis-like symmetry-broken branch, characterized by increased lateral displacement and Cobb-like angles, together with large (\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}}). These results suggest that normal sagittal curvature and scoliosis-like patterns can emerge from a single IEC–Cosserat model operating in different countercurvature regimes, providing an analog-gravity perspective on how biological information reshapes equilibrium geometry in a gravitational field.

## Short Abstract (≈180 words)

Living systems routinely generate and maintain structure against gravity, from plant stems to vertebrate spines. We propose a quantitative framework in which this behaviour is viewed as **biological countercurvature**: information-driven modification of the effective geometry experienced by a body in a gravitational field. Combining an information–elasticity coupling (IEC) model of spinal patterning with three-dimensional Cosserat rod mechanics (PyElastica), we treat the rod in gravity as an analog spacetime and the IEC field (I(s)) as a source of effective countercurvature. On the body axis we define a biological metric (d\ell_{\mathrm{eff}}^{2} = g_{\mathrm{eff}}(s) \cdot ds^{2}) derived from (I(s)), and use it to construct a normalized geodesic curvature deviation (\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}}) between gravity-selected and information-shaped curvature profiles. Across spinal, plant-like, and microgravity simulations, (\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}}) cleanly separates gravity-dominated, cooperative, and information-dominated regimes. Introducing a small thoracic asymmetry in (I(s)) or lateral rest curvature, we further identify an information-dominated region where the same perturbation is amplified into a scoliosis-like symmetry-broken branch. Normal sagittal curvature and scoliosis-like patterns thus arise from a single IEC–Cosserat model operating in distinct countercurvature regimes.

## Alternative Shorter Version (200 words)

Biological systems generate organized structure against gravitational sag—plants grow upward, spines maintain curvature, neural structures adapt in microgravity. We propose that information processing acts as effective "biological countercurvature" of spacetime, reshaping body geometry. We implement this using Cosserat rod mechanics as analog spacetime, where information field I(s) modifies mechanical properties through Information-Elasticity Coupling. We define Riemannian metric g_eff(s) = exp(2φ(s)) on the body axis, weighting regions of high information processing. We quantify information-driven deviations via geodesic curvature deviation D_geo, measuring distance between passive (gravity-only) and information-coupled curvature profiles. Using spinal modes, microgravity adaptation, and plant-like growth experiments, we show D_geo_norm persists as gravity is reduced, demonstrating information-driven structure is maintained independently of gravitational curvature. We construct phase diagram in (χ_κ, g) space identifying three regimes: gravity-dominated, cooperative, and information-dominated. Our framework bridges mechanical simulations, information fields, and Riemannian geometry, offering computational tool for exploring how biological information reshapes effective spacetime geometry—an analog model connecting consciousness to local metric modifications without modifying Einstein's equations.
