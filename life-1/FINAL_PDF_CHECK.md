# Final PDF Check - 5 Minutes Before Submit

**Purpose:** Catch typesetting errors, not science errors
**Time:** 5 minutes
**Do this:** After compiling final PDF, before uploading to PRX Life

---

- [ ] **Affiliation:** Yashoda Hospitals, Malakpet, Hyderabad, India
- [ ] **Email:** dr.sayujkrishnan@gmail.com (check for typos!)
- [ ] **Date:** Shows correctly (or remove if journal style doesn't use it)

---

## ✅ Abstract (Page 1)

- [ ] **Length:** ~250 words (PRX Life typically wants 150-250)
- [ ] **Key terms present:** "countercurvature", "$\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}}$", "IEC", "scoliosis"
- [ ] **No typos** in first 2 sentences (most critical for editor/reviewer first impression)

---

## ✅ Section Order (Skim Headers)

- [ ] **Significance** (required by PRX Life)
- [ ] **Introduction**
- [ ] **Methods** (with subsections)
- [ ] **Results** (with subsections)
- [ ] **Discussion** (with subsections)
- [ ] **Limitations and Outlook**
- [ ] **Conclusion**
- [ ] **Code Availability**
- [ ] **Data Availability**
- [ ] **Figures** (or embedded)
- [ ] **References**

## ✅ Figures (Critical Check)

### Figure 1 (4 panels)
- [ ] **Panel A visible:** Curvature profiles plot
- [ ] **Panel B visible:** Countercurvature metric plot
- [ ] **Panel C visible:** Geodesic deviation vs χ_κ
- [ ] **Panel D visible:** Microgravity adaptation plot
- [ ] **Caption starts:** "Information-driven countercurvature in spine-like..."
- [ ] **Caption references:** "Panel A shows...", "Panel B...", "Panel C...", "Panel D..."

### Figure 2
- [ ] **Image visible:** Phase diagram heatmap
- [ ] **Caption starts:** "Phase diagram in (χ_κ, g)..."
- [ ] **Axes labeled:** χ_κ on x-axis, g on y-axis

### In-text references
- [ ] **Scan for:** "Figure 1", "Fig. 1", "Figure~1" → Should reference 4-panel figure
- [ ] **Scan for:** "Figure 2", "Fig. 2", "Figure~2" → Should reference phase diagram
- [ ] **No:** "Figure 3" or higher (you only have 2 figures)

---

## ✅ Math Notation (Spot Check)

Open to **Methods section** and check these render correctly:

- [ ] $\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}}$ (with hat and subscript "geo")
- [ ] $\chi_{\kappa}$ (chi with kappa subscript)
- [ ] $g_{\mathrm{eff}}(s)$ (g with eff subscript)
- [ ] $I(s)$ (capital I, not lowercase l or 1)
- [ ] $S_{\mathrm{lat}}$ (S with lat subscript)
- [ ] $\kappa_0(s)$ and $\kappa_I(s)$ (kappa with subscripts)

**If any look wrong:** Check LaTeX source, recompile

---

## ✅ Citations (Spot Check)

### In Introduction
- [ ] Grimes et al. 2016 cited when discussing cilia/CSF
- [ ] Wellik 2007 cited when discussing HOX/PAX

### In Methods
- [ ] PyElastica citations present (Gazzola, pyelastica_zenodo)
- [ ] Antman 2005 for Cosserat rods
- [ ] Lee 2018 for Riemannian geometry

### In Discussion
- [ ] Weinstein 2008 or White & Panjabi for scoliosis biomechanics
- [ ] Einstein 1916 or Wald 1984 for GR (in analog gravity section)
- [ ] Green 2018 or Marfia 2023 for microgravity

### At end
- [ ] **No "[?]" or "??" in citations** (means missing bib entry)
- [ ] References section starts (should be auto-generated by BibTeX)

---

## ✅ References Section (Quick Scan)

- [ ] **First entry:** Should start with number [1] or author name
- [ ] **Formatting consistent:** All entries similar style
- [ ] **URLs work:** If any DOI or URL links, spot-check 1-2
- [ ] **Count:** Should be ~15-20 entries (you have 15+ in refs.bib)

**Don't read all references**, just verify the section exists and looks formatted.

---

## ✅ Code & Data Availability Sections

### Code Availability
- [ ] **GitHub URL present:** https://github.com/sayujks0071/life
- [ ] **Zenodo DOI present:** 10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX (or note to add after submission)
- [ ] **Version noted:** v0.1.0
- [ ] **License noted:** MIT
- [ ] **Contact:** dr.sayujkrishnan@gmail.com

### Data Availability
- [ ] States data is regenerable
- [ ] References `outputs/` directory
- [ ] Notes typical runtime (5-30 minutes)

---

## ✅ Page Count & Layout

- [ ] **Total pages:** ~10-15 (typical for PRX Life methods paper)
- [ ] **No orphaned section headers** at page breaks (header at bottom, text on next page)
- [ ] **Figures not cut off** at page edges
- [ ] **No blank pages** inserted accidentally

---

## ✅ Final Skim (2 minutes)

**Open PDF and scroll through at 2 seconds per page, looking for:**

- [ ] **Any red/highlighted text** (uncommented LaTeX commands)
- [ ] **Any "TODO" or "FIXME"** left in text
- [ ] **Any overfull/underfull boxes** (text running into margins)
- [ ] **First sentence of each section** makes sense

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Check (Don't Waste Time)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Re-read the science (you've already reviewed it)
- ❌ Verify every equation derivation (trust your earlier work)
- ❌ Check every reference detail (BibTeX handles this)
- ❌ Rewrite sentences for "better" phrasing (good enough is good enough)
- ❌ Second-guess your figure design (they're publication-quality)

**This is a TYPO check, not a REVISION.**

---

## ✅ If Everything Above Checks Out

**You're ready to upload.** 🚀

**If you find issues:**
- Fix in LaTeX source
- Recompile: `pdflatex → bibtex → pdflatex → pdflatex`
- Re-run this checklist
- Upload
