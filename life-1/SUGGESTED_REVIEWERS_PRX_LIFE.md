## Recommended Combination (Balanced Coverage)

**PRX Life typically wants 3-5 suggested reviewers.** Here's my recommendation:

### Option A: Mechanics-Heavy (Computational Focus)
1. **Mattia Gazzola** (Cosserat rods, PyElastica)
2. **Diane Grimes** (Scoliosis biology, cilia-CSF)
3. **Alain Goriely** (Mathematical biology, growth mechanics)
4. **Carlos Barceló** (Analog gravity)

**Rationale:** Strong technical reviewers who will rigorously evaluate methods + interdisciplinary reach

---

### Option B: Biology-Balanced (Broader Appeal)
1. **Mattia Gazzola** (Cosserat rods, PyElastica)
2. **Diane Grimes** (Scoliosis biology, cilia-CSF)
3. **Ian Stokes** (Scoliosis biomechanics)
4. **L. Mahadevan** (Biological mechanics, soft matter)

**Rationale:** Ensures both computational and biological/clinical perspectives are represented

---

### Option C: Interdisciplinary-Maximized (PRX Life Spirit)
1. **Mattia Gazzola** (Cosserat rods, PyElastica)
2. **Diane Grimes** (Scoliosis biology, cilia-CSF)
3. **Alain Goriely** (Mathematical biology)
4. **Carol Wise** (Genetic basis of IS)
5. **Carlos Barceló** (Analog gravity)

**Rationale:** Spans mechanics → biology → genetics → physics, showcasing the framework's broad relevance

---

## My Top Recommendation

**Go with Option C** (5 reviewers from all tiers). PRX Life loves interdisciplinary breadth, and you genuinely touch on all these areas. This maximizes the chance that the editor finds at least 2-3 who accept.

**Must-include:**
- **Mattia Gazzola** (your methods expert)
- **Diane Grimes** (you cite her work, she'll get the biology-mechanics bridge)

**Strong additions:**
- **Alain Goriely** (mathematical biology, perfect fit)
- **Carol Wise** or **Ian Stokes** (scoliosis expertise)

**Wild card:**
- **Carlos Barceló** (validates the analog gravity framing)

## Potential Conflicts of Interest (To Declare)

**None.**

You don't have:
- Co-authors on this manuscript
- Recent collaborators (<3 years)
- Current grant collaborators
- Advisors/advisees
- Same institution conflicts

**Citing someone's work is NOT a conflict.** You cite Gazzola (PyElastica) and Grimes (cilia-CSF), but that's standard scholarly practice.

---

## Reviewers to **Avoid** (Potential Negative Bias)

### 1. Pure Clinicians (Orthopedic Surgeons) Without Modeling Background
- **Why:** May dismiss theoretical framework as "not clinically actionable yet"
- **Examples:** Clinical scoliosis surgeons focused only on Cobb angles and surgical outcomes

### 2. Pure Experimental Biologists Without Mechanics Background
- **Why:** May struggle with the Cosserat rod formalism and geometric concepts
- **Examples:** Cell biology labs without quantitative/computational expertise

### 3. Pure General Relativists Without Applied/Analog Experience
- **Why:** May be dismissive of "analog gravity" as not fundamental physics
- **Examples:** String theorists, cosmologists focused on quantum gravity

### 4. Anyone Working on Competing Scoliosis Models
- **Why:** Potential bias if they have their own phenomenological model
- **Examples:** Check recent JBIOMECH papers on scoliosis modeling—avoid those authors

## What to Do If Your Top Choices Decline

**The editor will likely reach out to 5-8 reviewers and get 2-3 acceptances.** If several decline:

**Backup Tier 1 (Mechanics):**
- Oliver O'Reilly (UC Berkeley, nonlinear rods)
- Basile Audoly (CNRS, elastic rods and shells)

**Backup Tier 2 (Biology):**
- Phil Bayly (Washington U, brain biomechanics, developmental)
- Michael Levin (Tufts, morphogenesis, bioelectricity, information in development)

**Backup Tier 3 (Computational):**
- Tamar Schlick (NYU, computational biophysics)
- Adrian Buganza Tepole (Purdue, growth mechanics)

## Final Notes

1. **Don't overthink this.** The editor knows how to find reviewers. Your suggestions just help narrow the field.

2. **PRX Life editors are sophisticated.** They'll pick reviewers who understand interdisciplinary work.

3. **If Gazzola reviews, be prepared for deep technical questions** about the PyElastica integration and static equilibrium convergence. (But your code is solid, so you're fine.)

4. **If Grimes reviews, be prepared for questions** about connecting I(s) to actual gene expression or CSF flow data. (Your "future work" section handles this.)

5. **If Barceló reviews, be prepared for questions** about whether the geometric interpretation is necessary or just pedagogical. (Your Discussion already addresses this.)
