# Code and Data Availability Sections for Manuscript

## LaTeX Source (Ready to Paste)

These sections have been added to `manuscript/main_countercurvature.tex` after the Conclusion section.

### Code Availability

```latex
\section*{Code Availability}

All simulations and metrics were implemented in the open-source \texttt{spinalmodes} package (v0.1.0). Source code, public API (\texttt{compute\_countercurvature\_metric}, \texttt{geodesic\_curvature\_deviation}, \texttt{compute\_scoliosis\_metrics}, \texttt{solve\_beam\_static}), and reproducible experiment scripts (\texttt{experiments/countercurvature/*}) are available at \url{<your GitHub URL>}. A minimal API is exposed via \texttt{spinalmodes.countercurvature.api}, and a 30-line demo is provided in \texttt{examples/quickstart.py}. Quickstart commands: \texttt{python examples/quickstart.py}, \texttt{python -m spinalmodes.experiments.countercurvature.experiment\_spine\_modes\_vs\_gravity --quick}, \texttt{python -m spinalmodes.experiments.countercurvature.experiment\_phase\_diagram --quick}.
```

### Data Availability

```latex
\section*{Data Availability}

All figures and numerical outputs in this study are generated by the scripts in \texttt{experiments/countercurvature/} and saved automatically to \texttt{outputs/}. Raw CSVs (e.g., \texttt{outputs/experiments/spine\_modes/spine\_modes\_results.csv}, \texttt{outputs/experiments/phase\_diagram/phase\_diagram\_data.csv}, \texttt{outputs/experiments/microgravity/microgravity\_results.csv}) and derived figures (e.g., \texttt{outputs/figs/fig\_countercurvature\_metrics.png}, \texttt{outputs/experiments/phase\_diagram/phase\_diagram.png}) are reproducible by running the provided commands. No external or proprietary datasets were used.

## Plain Text Version (for Reference)

### Code Availability

All simulations and metrics were implemented in the open-source `spinalmodes` package (v0.1.0). Source code, public API (`compute_countercurvature_metric`, `geodesic_curvature_deviation`, `compute_scoliosis_metrics`, `solve_beam_static`), and reproducible experiment scripts (`experiments/countercurvature/*`) are available at <your GitHub URL>. A minimal API is exposed via `spinalmodes.countercurvature.api`, and a 30-line demo is provided in `examples/quickstart.py`. Quickstart commands: `python examples/quickstart.py`, `python -m spinalmodes.experiments.countercurvature.experiment_spine_modes_vs_gravity --quick`, `python -m spinalmodes.experiments.countercurvature.experiment_phase_diagram --quick`.

### Data Availability

All figures and numerical outputs in this study are generated by the scripts in `experiments/countercurvature/` and saved automatically to `outputs/`. Raw CSVs (e.g., `outputs/experiments/spine_modes/spine_modes_results.csv`, `outputs/experiments/phase_diagram/phase_diagram_data.csv`, `outputs/experiments/microgravity/microgravity_results.csv`) and derived figures (e.g., `outputs/figs/fig_countercurvature_metrics.png`, `outputs/experiments/phase_diagram/phase_diagram.png`) are reproducible by running the provided commands. No external or proprietary datasets were used.

## Notes

1. **Replace `<your GitHub URL>`**: Update with actual repository URL before submission
2. **Version number**: Currently v0.1.0; update if you tag a different version
3. **Journal requirements**: Some journals want these as subsections under "Methods" or "Supplementary Information"; adjust sectioning as needed
4. **Length**: These are concise (~100 words each); expand if journal allows more detail
5. **Zenodo DOI**: If you archive the code on Zenodo, add: "Archived at Zenodo: \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX}"
