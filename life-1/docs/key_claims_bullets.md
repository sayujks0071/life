### 1. Information-selected spinal S-curve as a sine-like mode against gravity.

We show that the information-driven sagittal S-curve is dominated by a single smooth, sign-changing mode: $\kappa_{I}(s)$ exhibits only one sign change along the cranio--caudal axis and a max-to-RMS curvature ratio of $\approx 1.81$, with a normalized geodesic curvature deviation $\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}} \approx 0.14$ from the gravity-selected sag. This indicates that the mature spine behaves as a stabilized, sine-like counter-curvature mode rather than a small perturbation of a passive beam.

---

### 2. Persistence of the "spinal wave" in microgravity.

In a microgravity series, reducing the effective gravitational acceleration from $g = 1.0$ to $g = 0.10$ leaves the normalized geodesic curvature deviation essentially unchanged ($\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}} \approx 0.091$, 0.0% change to three decimal places), showing that the information-selected spinal curvature is geometrically stable even as the passive gravitational contribution weakens.

---

### 3. Distinct gravity-dominated and cooperative regimes in the phase diagram.

Across the $(\chi_{\kappa}, g)$ plane, we identify a gravity-dominated regime (e.g., $\chi_{\kappa} = 0.015$, $g = 9.81$) with $\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}} \approx 0.059$ and near-zero lateral indices, and a cooperative regime (e.g., $\chi_{\kappa} = 0.065$, $g = 9.81$) with $\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}} \approx 0.15$, where gravity and information jointly shape curvature. Within the present parameter window, the scoliosis-like regime remains a predicted extension at stronger coupling, rather than a realized branch.

---

### 4. Reproducible, open analog-gravity framework for spinal geometry.

All simulations, metrics, and figures are implemented in the open-source Python package `spinalmodes` (v0.1.0), which provides a documented public API (`compute_countercurvature_metric`, `geodesic_curvature_deviation`, `compute_scoliosis_metrics`, `solve_beam_static`) and scripted experiments with one-command full sweeps and automatic anchor-number extraction.

1. **Information-selected spinal S-curve as a sine-like mode against gravity.**

   We show that the information-driven sagittal S-curve is dominated by a single smooth, sign-changing mode: κ_I(s) exhibits only one sign change along the cranio–caudal axis and a max-to-RMS curvature ratio of ≈1.81, with a normalized geodesic curvature deviation D̂_geo ≈ 0.14 from the gravity-selected sag. This indicates that the mature spine behaves as a stabilized, sine-like counter-curvature mode rather than a small perturbation of a passive beam.

2. **Persistence of the "spinal wave" in microgravity.**

   In a microgravity series, reducing the effective gravitational acceleration from g = 1.0 to g = 0.10 leaves the normalized geodesic curvature deviation essentially unchanged (D̂_geo ≈ 0.091, 0.0% change to three decimal places), showing that the information-selected spinal curvature is geometrically stable even as the passive gravitational contribution weakens.

3. **Distinct gravity-dominated and cooperative regimes in the phase diagram.**

   Across the (χ_κ, g) plane, we identify a gravity-dominated regime (e.g., χ_κ = 0.015, g = 9.81) with D̂_geo ≈ 0.059 and near-zero lateral indices, and a cooperative regime (e.g., χ_κ = 0.065, g = 9.81) with D̂_geo ≈ 0.15, where gravity and information jointly shape curvature. Within the present parameter window, the scoliosis-like regime remains a predicted extension at stronger coupling, rather than a realized branch.

4. **Reproducible, open analog-gravity framework for spinal geometry.**

   All simulations, metrics, and figures are implemented in the open-source Python package `spinalmodes` (v0.1.0), which provides a documented public API (`compute_countercurvature_metric`, `geodesic_curvature_deviation`, `compute_scoliosis_metrics`, `solve_beam_static`) and scripted experiments with one-command full sweeps and automatic anchor-number extraction.

## Concise Version (For Short Forms)

**Use this when space is limited:**

1. Information-selected spinal S-curve: single sign-changing mode (max/RMS ≈ 1.81, D̂_geo ≈ 0.14), indicating a stabilized sine-like counter-curvature against gravity.

2. Microgravity persistence: D̂_geo ≈ 0.091 unchanged from g=1.0 to g=0.10, showing geometric stability independent of gravitational strength.

3. Phase diagram: gravity-dominated (χ_κ=0.015, D̂_geo≈0.059) and cooperative (χ_κ=0.065, D̂_geo≈0.15) regimes identified; scoliosis remains predicted extension.

4. Open-source framework: `spinalmodes` v0.1.0 with documented API, scripted experiments, and reproducible full sweeps.

## Single-Sentence Version (For Very Short Forms)

1. Information-driven spinal S-curve exhibits a single sign-changing mode (max/RMS ≈ 1.81, D̂_geo ≈ 0.14), behaving as a stabilized sine-like counter-curvature against gravity.

2. The information-selected spinal curvature persists in microgravity (D̂_geo ≈ 0.091, unchanged from g=1.0 to g=0.10), demonstrating geometric stability independent of gravitational strength.

3. Phase diagram reveals gravity-dominated (χ_κ=0.015, D̂_geo≈0.059) and cooperative (χ_κ=0.065, D̂_geo≈0.15) regimes; scoliosis remains a predicted extension at stronger coupling.

4. Open-source `spinalmodes` v0.1.0 provides reproducible framework with documented API and one-command full sweeps.
