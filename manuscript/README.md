Figure files are expected in the `figures/` directory, with LaTeX also checking `../figures/main/` as specified in the Makefile's TEXINPUTS path.

## Version Notes

### Sections Evaluation
The repository contains alternative section versions in `/edited_sections/` with `_v2` suffix. After evaluation:
- Most v2 sections are empty placeholders or incomplete
- Current sections in `manuscript/sections/` are complete and comprehensive
- The existing sections have been retained as the authoritative versions

### Bibliography Consolidation
The bibliography has been consolidated from multiple sources to ensure:
- No duplicate entries (2 duplicates removed)
- All cited references are included
- Comprehensive coverage of related literature (44 entries total)

## Quality Checks
