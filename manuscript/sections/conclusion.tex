\section{Conclusion}

We have presented a theoretical framework for \emph{Biological Countercurvature}, positing that the geometry of the spine is determined by the interaction between a developmental information field and the gravitational environment. By coupling a Cosserat rod model with an Information--Elasticity mechanism, we demonstrated that the spinal S-curve emerges as a gravity-selected mode---a stable equilibrium accessible only when information modifies the effective metric of the structure. This framework unifies the understanding of normal spinal development, microgravity adaptation, and pathological deformity (scoliosis) under a single physical principle: the shaping of biological spacetime by genetic information. Ongoing work coupling the IEC framework to longitudinal gene expression atlases and prospective clinical cohorts will further test these predictions and pave the way for information-guided spinal medicine.
