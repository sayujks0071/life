# Significance / Author Summary

## Significance

Why does life so often grow and stand "against" gravity? In this work we develop a concrete mechanical model where developmental and neural information fields reshape the equilibrium geometry of a spine-like structure in a gravitational field. Using a Cosserat rod in gravity as an analog spacetime, and an information–elasticity coupling as a source of "biological countercurvature," we show how normal human-like S-shaped spinal profiles, plant-like upward growth, microgravity adaptation, and scoliosis-like lateral deviations can all be generated within a single framework. A metric derived from the information field lets us treat normal and pathological curvatures as different "geodesics" in an information-modified geometry. This provides a quantitative language for how biological information can stabilize, redirect, or destabilize the shapes that gravity alone would select.

## Alternative Versions

### Very Short (1-2 sentences)

Living systems generate structure against gravity—plants grow upward, spines maintain curvature. We develop a mechanical model where information fields reshape body geometry, treating normal and pathological spinal curvatures as different "geodesics" in an information-modified effective spacetime.

### Extended (for detailed Significance section)

Why do living systems so consistently generate and maintain structure that opposes gravitational sag? Plants grow upward, vertebrate spines adopt robust S-shaped profiles, and neural structures adapt in microgravity. In this work, we develop a quantitative mechanical framework that interprets such behavior as **biological countercurvature**: information-driven modification of the effective geometry experienced by a body in a gravitational field.

We combine an information–elasticity coupling (IEC) model of spinal patterning with three-dimensional Cosserat rod mechanics, treating the rod in gravity as an analog spacetime and the IEC information field as a source of effective countercurvature. By defining a biological metric derived from the information field, we can quantify how far information-shaped equilibrium geometries depart from the corresponding gravity-selected profiles.

Across a set of canonical simulations—human-like spinal S-curves, plant-like stems, and microgravity adaptation—we show that this framework cleanly separates gravity-dominated, cooperative, and information-dominated regimes. Remarkably, introducing a small thoracic asymmetry in the information field reveals an information-dominated region where the same perturbation is amplified into a scoliosis-like symmetry-broken branch. Normal sagittal curvature and scoliosis-like patterns thus emerge from a single IEC–Cosserat model operating in distinct countercurvature regimes.

This work provides a quantitative language for understanding how biological information can stabilize, redirect, or destabilize the shapes that gravity alone would select, offering a unified perspective on normal and pathological spinal geometry through the lens of analog-gravity physics.

## Key Results (Bullet List)

For use in Introduction, Cover Letter, or Executive Summary. See also `docs/key_results_bullets.md` for multiple versions.

### Technical Version (for Introduction/Cover Letter)

1. **Unified framework**: Normal sagittal spinal curvature and scoliosis-like lateral deviations emerge from a single Information–Elasticity Coupling (IEC) model operating in different countercurvature regimes.

2. **Quantitative phase diagram**: A Riemannian metric derived from information fields yields a phase diagram in (χ_κ, g) space that cleanly separates gravity-dominated, cooperative, and information-dominated regimes, with D̂_geo as the order parameter.

3. **Microgravity persistence**: Information-driven structure (quantified by D̂_geo) persists independently of gravitational loading: as g decreases from 1.0 to 0.01, passive curvature energy falls by [X]%, while D̂_geo changes by only [Y]%.

4. **Scoliosis bifurcation**: In the information-dominated regime, small thoracic asymmetries (5%) are amplified into scoliosis-like branches (Cobb-like angles >10°), while the same perturbation produces negligible deviation in the gravity-dominated regime.

5. **Analog-gravity perspective**: The framework provides a quantitative language for how biological information reshapes equilibrium geometry, treating normal and pathological curvatures as different "geodesics" in an information-modified effective spacetime.

### Accessible Version (for Significance/General Audience)

1. **Single framework for normal and pathological curvature**: The same model reproduces normal S-shaped spinal profiles and scoliosis-like lateral deviations, depending on how strongly information processing modifies the effective geometry.

2. **Three distinct regimes**: The framework identifies gravity-dominated, cooperative, and information-dominated regimes, with clear phase boundaries that predict when small asymmetries will be amplified into scoliosis-like patterns.

3. **Information maintains structure in microgravity**: Information-driven structure persists even as gravitational loading is reduced, demonstrating that biological information can maintain body geometry independently of gravity.

4. **Scoliosis as symmetry breaking**: Small thoracic asymmetries (5%) produce negligible lateral deviation in the gravity-dominated regime but are amplified into pronounced scoliosis-like deformations (Cobb-like angles >10°) in the information-dominated regime.

5. **Quantitative predictions**: The framework makes testable predictions for microgravity posture studies, scoliosis progression, and in vivo spinal curvature measurements, bridging theoretical physics and clinical biomechanics.
