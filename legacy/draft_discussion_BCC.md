\section{Discussion: From Information Fields to Deformity}

\subsection{Interpreting Biological Countercurvature}
Our results suggest that the adult spinal shape is best understood as a "standing wave" of counter-curvature, maintained by the continuous action of developmental information against gravity. The IEC framework provides a quantitative language for this: the information field $I(s)$ effectively "warps" the material metric, creating a potential well where the S-shape is the stable equilibrium. This explains why the spine does not collapse into a simple sag and why this geometry persists even in microgravity.

\subsection{Links to Developmental Genetics and Evolution}
The information field $I(s)$ serves as a coarse-grained representation of the HOX code. The peaks in our phenomenological $I(s)$ correspond to the cervical and lumbar regions, suggesting that specific HOX paralogs may function as "curvature generators" by modulating local growth rates or tissue stiffness. Evolutionarily, the transition to bipedalism likely involved the tuning of this information field to stabilize the S-mode against the increased gravitational moment of an upright posture.

\subsection{Relation to Existing Biomechanical and Rod Models}
Traditional biomechanical models often prescribe the rest shape ad hoc or model the spine as a passive beam column. Our approach differs by deriving the geometry from an underlying scalar field. This connects the mechanics to the developmental inputs. Furthermore, by using Cosserat rod theory, we capture the full 3D kinematics (twist, shear) essential for understanding how planar information fields can give rise to out-of-plane deformities like scoliosis.

\subsection{Limitations and Model Assumptions}
Our model assumes a deterministic, static information field. In reality, $I(s)$ is dynamic, emerging from complex reaction-diffusion systems and growth processes. We also simplified the complex anatomy of vertebrae and discs into a continuous rod. Finally, the mapping from genes to $I(s)$ remains phenomenological; future work requires explicit coupling to gene expression data.

\subsection{Future Directions}
Future extensions will focus on: (1) Patient-specific modeling, inferring $I(s)$ from medical imaging to predict progression of deformities. (2) Coupling the IEC framework to volumetric growth laws to model the developmental time-course of spinal curvature. (3) Investigating the role of sensory feedback (proprioception) as a dynamic component of the information field.
