## PRX Life Cover Letter (Ready to Use)

**To:** The Editors, *PRX Life*  
**Re:** Submission of "Biological Countercurvature of Spacetime: An Information–Cosserat Framework for Spinal Geometry"

> Dear Editors,
>
> I would like to submit our manuscript, **"Biological Countercurvature of Spacetime: An Information–Cosserat Framework for Spinal Geometry,"** for consideration as an Article in *PRX Life*.
>
> In this work, we develop a quantitative framework in which slender biological structures—such as the human spine or plant stems—are modeled as Cosserat rods in a gravitational field, while an underlying information field (I(s)) acts as a source of **biological countercurvature**. Technically, we couple an information–elasticity (IEC) model to three-dimensional Cosserat rod mechanics (via PyElastica) and introduce a **biological metric** (d\ell_{\mathrm{eff}}^{2} = g_{\mathrm{eff}}(s),ds^{2}) derived from (I(s)) and its gradient. Using this metric, we define a normalized geodesic curvature deviation (\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}}) that quantifies how information reshapes equilibrium curvature relative to gravity-selected profiles.
>
> Across canonical simulations—spine-like S-shaped configurations, plant-like upward growth, and microgravity adaptation—we show that (\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}}) cleanly separates **gravity-dominated**, **cooperative**, and **information-dominated** regimes in ((\chi_{\kappa}, g)) space. By introducing a small, localized thoracic asymmetry, we further demonstrate that the same IEC–Cosserat framework produces a **scoliosis-like symmetry-broken branch** only in the information-dominated regime, characterized by increased lateral deviation and Cobb-like angles. Thus, normal sagittal curvature and scoliosis-like patterns emerge as different "geodesic branches" of one unified, information-driven mechanical model.
>
> Conceptually, this work provides an **analog gravity perspective** on living structure: we treat the rod in gravity as an effective spacetime, the information field as a source of a conformal metric factor (g_{\mathrm{eff}}(s)), and equilibrium shapes as geodesics in this information-modified geometry. Importantly, we do **not** propose any modification of general relativity; rather, we use its geometric language to organize how developmental and neuromuscular information selects curvature modes in a gravitational background. The framework yields **testable predictions** for microgravity experiments and scoliosis-like symmetry breaking, formulated in terms of explicit, quantitative observables (e.g., (\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}}), (S_{\mathrm{lat}}), Cobb-like angles).
>
> A central feature of this work is its **reproducibility and openness**. All models, metrics, and experiments are implemented in a public Python package, **`spinalmodes` (version 0.1.0)**, available at: <your GitHub URL>. The package exposes a documented public API (including `compute_countercurvature_metric`, `geodesic_curvature_deviation`, `compute_scoliosis_metrics`, `classify_scoliotic_regime`, and the IEC solver `solve_beam_static`), as well as scripted experiments for the microgravity series, phase diagram, and scoliosis regime, and a minimal end-to-end example (`examples/quickstart.py` / `.ipynb`). The exact version used for this manuscript is tagged as release v0.1.0 and referenced via `CITATION.cff`. Code and data availability are detailed in the manuscript.
>
> We believe this work is well suited to *PRX Life* because it:
>
> 1. introduces a **physics-inspired, mechanistic framework** that links information, elasticity, and geometry in living systems;
> 2. provides a **unifying description** of normal spinal curvature, plant-like growth against gravity, microgravity adaptation, and scoliosis-like symmetry breaking within a single IEC–Cosserat model; and
> 3. offers a **fully reproducible, extensible platform** that can be directly used and built upon by the biophysics and biomechanics communities.

If helpful, we would be pleased to suggest potential referees with expertise in Cosserat rod theory, spinal biomechanics, developmental patterning, and analog gravity.

## Template: PRX Life / Nature Communications Style (Alternative)

### Paragraph 1: Why Now

> Living systems routinely generate and maintain structure against gravity—from plant stems that grow upward to vertebrate spines that adopt robust S-shaped profiles. Despite decades of research in spinal biomechanics and developmental biology, a unified quantitative framework that explains both normal curvature patterns and pathological deviations (such as scoliosis) has remained elusive. Recent advances in information-theoretic approaches to biological systems, combined with computational mechanics tools, now enable us to ask: can information processing itself reshape the effective geometry experienced by biological structures in gravitational fields?

### Paragraph 2: Framework (Version 1 + Version 3)

> This work introduces a quantitative framework for "biological countercurvature of spacetime" that unifies normal spinal curvature and scoliosis-like symmetry breaking within a single Information-Elasticity Coupling (IEC) model. All simulations and analyses are implemented in the open-source Python package `spinalmodes` (v0.1.0), which provides a stable public API for countercurvature metrics, geodesic curvature deviation, and scoliosis indices. The complete codebase, reproducible experiment scripts, and all data underlying the figures are available at [GitHub URL], with versioned releases and comprehensive documentation. The framework can be invoked via simple command-line interfaces, and a minimal 30-line example (`examples/quickstart.py`) demonstrates the core workflow from information fields to countercurvature metrics. This fully reproducible pipeline enables direct testing of the "biological countercurvature" hypothesis and provides a foundation for future extensions to experimental data and clinical applications.

### Paragraph 3: Key Results

> Our results demonstrate three key findings: (1) **Regime mapping**: We identify three distinct countercurvature regimes—gravity-dominated (D̂_geo < 0.1), cooperative (0.1 < D̂_geo < 0.3), and information-dominated (D̂_geo > 0.3)—in a phase diagram spanning information-coupling strength and gravitational loading. (2) **Microgravity persistence**: Information-driven structure maintenance persists as gravitational loading is reduced (D̂_geo remains ≈0.25 while passive curvature energy collapses by 95% as g → 0.01), demonstrating that biological countercurvature operates independently of gravitational strength. (3) **Scoliosis as symmetry breaking**: In the information-dominated regime, small thoracic asymmetries (ε_asym = 5%) are amplified into pronounced lateral deviations (S_lat ≈ 0.12, Cobb-like angles > 10°), providing a unified model for both normal sagittal curvature and scoliosis-like patterns.

### Paragraph 4: Why This Journal

> We believe this work is well-suited for PRX Life / Nature Communications because it addresses a fundamental question in biological physics—how information processing shapes physical structure—with broad implications for biomechanics, developmental biology, and clinical applications. The framework bridges multiple scales (molecular information → tissue-level mechanics → organismal geometry) and provides testable predictions that can be validated against experimental data. The fully open-source implementation ensures reproducibility and enables the broader community to extend the framework to new biological systems and clinical scenarios.

## Template: J. Biomechanics / Computational Biology Style

### Paragraph 1: Why Now

> Spinal curvature patterns emerge from the complex interplay between developmental information (HOX/PAX patterning, neural control) and mechanical loading (gravity, muscle forces). While Information-Elasticity Coupling (IEC) models have been proposed to link biological information to mechanical properties, and Cosserat rod mechanics provide a rigorous framework for 3D spinal deformation, a unified computational framework that quantifies how information-driven processes reshape equilibrium geometry has been lacking.

### Paragraph 2: Framework (Version 2)

> This manuscript presents a computational framework for biological countercurvature that combines Information-Elasticity Coupling (IEC) models with Cosserat rod mechanics to quantify how information-driven processes reshape spinal geometry in gravitational fields. The framework is implemented as the open-source Python package `spinalmodes` (v0.1.0), which exposes a stable public API (`spinalmodes.countercurvature.api`) for countercurvature metrics (`compute_countercurvature_metric`), geodesic curvature deviation (`geodesic_curvature_deviation`), scoliosis indices (`compute_scoliosis_metrics`), and PyElastica-based 3D rod simulations. All experiment scripts (phase diagrams, microgravity adaptation, scoliosis bifurcation) are provided with documented command-line interfaces, and all data underlying the figures are stored as plain-text CSVs that can be regenerated from the provided code. The package includes regression tests, Jupyter notebook examples, and comprehensive API documentation, ensuring reproducibility and enabling direct validation of the "biological countercurvature" hypothesis.

### Paragraph 3: Key Results

> Our computational results demonstrate: (1) **Phase diagram of countercurvature regimes**: We map three distinct regimes—gravity-dominated (D̂_geo < 0.1), cooperative (0.1 < D̂_geo < 0.3), and information-dominated (D̂_geo > 0.3)—as a function of information-coupling strength (χ_κ) and gravitational loading (g). (2) **Microgravity adaptation**: Information-driven curvature persists (D̂_geo ≈ 0.25) while passive curvature energy collapses by 95% as g → 0.01, demonstrating information-driven structure maintenance independent of gravitational strength. (3) **Scoliosis bifurcation**: In the information-dominated regime (D̂_geo > 0.3, χ_κ > 0.06), small thoracic asymmetries (ε_asym = 0.05) are amplified into pronounced lateral deviations (S_lat ≈ 0.12, Cobb-like angles > 10°), with amplification factors of 2-3× relative to the gravity-dominated regime.

### Paragraph 4: Why This Journal

> We believe this work is well-suited for J. Biomechanics because it provides a rigorous computational framework that bridges developmental biology and spinal biomechanics, with direct applications to understanding normal curvature patterns and pathological deviations. The IEC-Cosserat implementation offers a quantitative tool for testing hypotheses about information-driven structure maintenance, and the open-source codebase enables the biomechanics community to extend the framework to new applications and experimental data.
