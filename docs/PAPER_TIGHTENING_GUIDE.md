# Paper Tightening Guide: Minimal Edits That Add Impact

## Purpose

This guide provides specific, surgical edits to transform vague draft language into precise, quantitative statements. Each edit should take <5 minutes but significantly improves clarity and impact.

---

## 1. Abstract Tightening

### Current Vague Phrases → Replace With

#### Before:
> "D̂_geo_norm persists or increases as gravitational loading is reduced"

#### After:
> "D̂_geo_norm remains at [X] (changing by <[Y]%) as g decreases from 1.0 to 0.01, while passive curvature energy falls by [Z]%"

#### Before:
> "small thoracic asymmetries (1–5%) in the information field are amplified into scoliosis-like lateral deformations"

#### After:
> "a 5% thoracic asymmetry increases S_lat from [X] to [Y] (amplification factor [Z]) and Cobb-like angles from [A]° to [B]° in the information-dominated regime"

### Checklist

- [ ] Insert 1–2 specific numerical contrasts
- [ ] Replace "pronounced" with actual ranges
- [ ] Replace "small/large" with threshold values
- [ ] Add magnitude of change (percentage or ratio)

## 2. Results Subsection Tightening

### Replace Vague Thresholds

#### Before:
> "In the gravity-dominated regime of the phase diagram (low χ_κ, high g), the asymmetric and symmetric solutions remained nearly indistinguishable"

#### After:
> "In the gravity-dominated regime (χ_κ = 0.01, g = 1.0), a 5% thoracic perturbation changes S_lat by <0.01 (from [X] to [Y]) and Cobb-like angles by <3° (from [A]° to [B]°)"

#### Before:
> "pronounced lateral deformations... S_lat ≳ 0.05 and Cobb-like angles exceeded ~5–10°"

#### After:
> "pronounced lateral deformations: S_lat increases from [X] to [Y] (≥0.05) and Cobb-like angles from [A]° to [B]° (>10°)"

### Replace Vague Regime Descriptions

#### Before:
> "gravity-dominated (low D_geo_norm), cooperative (intermediate), and information-dominated (high D_geo_norm)"

#### After:
> "gravity-dominated (D̂_geo_norm < 0.1), cooperative (0.1 ≤ D̂_geo_norm ≤ 0.3), and information-dominated (D̂_geo_norm > 0.3)"

### Checklist

- [ ] Replace "low/intermediate/high" with numerical thresholds
- [ ] Replace "nearly indistinguishable" with actual differences
- [ ] Replace "pronounced" with specific ranges
- [ ] Replace "exceeded ~5–10°" with actual values
- [ ] Add amplification factors where relevant

## 3. Microgravity Section Tightening

### Before:
> "As gravity decreases, the passive curvature energy collapses, but D̂_geo_norm remains roughly constant or even increases slightly"

### After:
> "As g decreases from 1.0 to 0.01, passive curvature energy falls by [X]% (from [Y] to [Z]), while D̂_geo_norm changes by only [A]% (from [B] to [C]), demonstrating that information-driven structure persists independently of gravitational loading"

### Checklist

- [ ] Specify exact g values (not just "as gravity decreases")
- [ ] Give percentage changes for both metrics
- [ ] Provide absolute values for context
- [ ] State the conclusion explicitly

## 4. Phase Diagram Section Tightening

### Before:
> "We identify three distinct regimes: (1) Gravity-dominated (D̂_geo < 0.05): Information coupling is weak; the system follows gravitational geodesics with minimal correction. (2) Cooperative (0.05 < D̂_geo < 0.2): Information reshapes modes but doesn't completely override gravity. (3) Information-dominated (D̂_geo > 0.2): Effective geometry is strongly warped by the information field"

### After:
> "We identify three distinct regimes: (1) Gravity-dominated (D̂_geo_norm < 0.1, χ_κ < 0.02 at g = 1.0): Information coupling is weak; S_lat < 0.01 and Cobb-like angles <3° even with 5% asymmetry. (2) Cooperative (0.1 ≤ D̂_geo_norm ≤ 0.3): Information reshapes modes; S_lat = [X]–[Y] and Cobb-like angles = [A]°–[B]°. (3) Information-dominated (D̂_geo_norm > 0.3, χ_κ > 0.04 at reduced g): Effective geometry is strongly warped; S_lat ≥ 0.05 and Cobb-like angles >10° with the same 5% asymmetry"

### Checklist

- [ ] Specify threshold values for D̂_geo_norm
- [ ] Add typical parameter ranges (χ_κ, g) for each regime
- [ ] Include scoliosis metrics for each regime
- [ ] Make regime boundaries quantitative, not qualitative

---

## 5. Significance Section Tightening

### Before:
> "The same IEC–Cosserat framework that explains normal sagittal curvature also admits a bifurcating lateral branch when information-driven countercurvature overwhelms the gravitational background"

### After:
> "The same IEC–Cosserat framework reproduces normal S-shaped curvature (D̂_geo_norm < 0.1, S_lat < 0.01) and scoliosis-like deviations (D̂_geo_norm > 0.3, Cobb-like angles >10°) under different countercurvature regimes, with a 5% thoracic asymmetry serving as the bifurcation trigger"

### Checklist

- [ ] Add specific metric values for "normal" vs "scoliotic"
- [ ] Specify the perturbation magnitude
- [ ] Make the bifurcation quantitative

## 6. General Language Improvements

### Replace Subjective Adjectives

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "pronounced" | "S_lat ≥ 0.05 and Cobb-like angles >10°" |
| "nearly indistinguishable" | "S_lat changes by <0.01" |
| "large deviation" | "D̂_geo_norm > 0.3" |
| "small deviation" | "D̂_geo_norm < 0.1" |
| "roughly constant" | "changes by <[X]%" |
| "significant" | "exceeds threshold [X]" |

### Add Quantitative Context

#### Before:
> "Information-driven structure is maintained independently of gravitational curvature"

#### After:
> "Information-driven structure (D̂_geo_norm = [X]) is maintained independently of gravitational curvature, with <[Y]% change as g decreases from 1.0 to 0.01, while passive curvature energy falls by [Z]%"

---

## 7. Methods Section Precision

### Before:
> "typically ε_asym ~ 0.05"

### After:
> "ε_asym = 0.05 (5% relative perturbation amplitude)"

### Before:
> "thresholds for classification"

### After:
> "thresholds: D̂_geo_norm < 0.1 (gravity-dominated), 0.1 ≤ D̂_geo_norm ≤ 0.3 (cooperative), D̂_geo_norm > 0.3 (information-dominated); S_lat ≥ 0.05 and Cobb-like angle ≥ 5° (scoliotic regime)"

## 8. Quick Pass Checklist

Before finalizing paper, do one pass checking:

- [ ] Every "pronounced/large/significant" has a number
- [ ] Every "small/minimal" has a threshold
- [ ] Every "roughly/approximately" has a percentage or range
- [ ] Every regime description has numerical boundaries
- [ ] Every comparison has actual values, not just "increased/decreased"
- [ ] All percentages are calculated and verified
- [ ] All thresholds match `RegimeThresholds` defaults (or are explicitly stated if different)

## Time Estimate

- **Abstract**: 10 minutes (insert 2–3 numbers)
- **Results**: 20 minutes (replace 5–10 vague phrases)
- **Significance**: 5 minutes (add 1–2 concrete phrases)
- **Methods**: 5 minutes (specify thresholds)
- **Total**: ~40 minutes for a complete tightening pass

## Example: Before/After Comparison

### Before (Vague):
> "In the information-dominated regime, small thoracic asymmetries produce pronounced lateral deformations, with large D̂_geo_norm values indicating strong information-driven countercurvature."

### After (Quantitative):
> "In the information-dominated regime (χ_κ = 0.05, g = 0.1, D̂_geo_norm = 0.35), a 5% thoracic asymmetry (ε_asym = 0.05) produces pronounced lateral deformations: S_lat increases from 0.002 to 0.062 (31× amplification) and Cobb-like angles from 0.5° to 12.3°, demonstrating how information-driven countercurvature amplifies small perturbations into scoliosis-like symmetry-broken branches."
