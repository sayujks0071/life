## Research Framework

### Central Hypothesis
Defective motile-cilia-driven CSF flow is the proximal cause of adolescent-onset idiopathic scoliosis, with upstream genetic variants (PTK7, CCDC40, CCDC151, DYX1C1, C21ORF59) acting through ciliary architecture and regulation.

### Three-Pronged Approach

#### Aim 1: Zebrafish Model Validation
- **Objective**: Define how motile-cilia gene perturbations disrupt CSF flow and trigger scoliosis
- **Models**: PTK7, CCDC40, CCDC151, DYX1C1, C21ORF59 mutants
- **Readouts**: CSF flow velocity, cilia morphology, hydrocephalus index, spinal curvature
- **Timeline**: 4 weeks for pilot validation, 12 weeks for full characterization

#### Aim 2: Temporal Requirements
- **Objective**: Map the developmental window where motile-cilia function is essential
- **Models**: Temperature-sensitive alleles with controlled timing
- **Readouts**: Flow recovery curves, curve progression, growth metrics
- **Timeline**: 8 weeks for temperature-shift experiments

#### Aim 3: Translational Biomarkers
- **Objective**: Evaluate CSF flow and ciliary biomarkers in human IS patients
- **Cohort**: 200 adolescents (100 cases, 100 controls)
- **Readouts**: MRI flow rates, serum biomarkers, nasal cilia function
- **Timeline**: 24 months recruitment, 18 months follow-up
