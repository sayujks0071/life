## Abstract

**Background:** Idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is a three-dimensional spinal deformity of unclear origin, affecting ~3% of otherwise healthy children. Emerging evidence suggests that IS may be a ciliopathy-like condition, meaning defects in cilia (both motile and primary) could contribute to spinal curve development.

**Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive review of genetic studies, animal models, and computational analyses linking ciliary biology to idiopathic scoliosis. We examined genes with dual roles in IS and ciliary function, analyzed mechanistic pathways, and evaluated experimental validation approaches.

**Results:** Multiple genes identified in IS patients play critical roles in ciliary structure or signaling, including POC5, KIF7, and TTLL11. Computational network analyses reveal enrichment of ciliary and cytoskeletal pathways in IS-associated genes. Animal models demonstrate that ciliary dysfunction can cause scoliosis-like phenotypes through multiple mechanisms: Hedgehog signaling defects, cerebrospinal fluid flow disruption, centrosome dysfunction, and microtubule modification abnormalities.

**Conclusions:** The convergence of genetic, computational, and experimental evidence strongly supports ciliary dysfunction as a major contributor to idiopathic scoliosis pathogenesis. We propose specific experimental approaches to validate candidate genes and identify therapeutic targets.

## 1. Introduction

Idiopathic scoliosis (IS) is a three-dimensional spinal deformity of unclear origin, affecting ~3% of otherwise healthy children [1, 2]. Emerging evidence suggests that IS may be a ciliopathy-like condition, meaning defects in cilia (both motile and primary) could contribute to spinal curve development [3, 4]. Cilia are antenna-like organelles present on most cells and are crucial for mechanosensation and signaling (e.g. Hedgehog pathway) [5, 6]. Notably, many human ciliopathy syndromes (e.g. certain skeletal dysplasias) include scoliosis as a symptom [7]. Furthermore, genetic studies of IS families and cohorts have repeatedly implicated genes with ciliary functions [8, 9]. Below, we detail the genes and pathways common to IS and ciliary biology, the supporting genetic and experimental evidence, and the mechanistic pathways (Hedgehog signaling, cerebrospinal fluid flow, centrosome function, microtubule modification) linking cilia to scoliosis. We also propose experimental approaches for validating candidate genes in this context.

### 1.1 The Ciliopathy-Scoliosis Connection

Ciliopathies are a diverse group of genetic disorders caused by defects in cilia structure or function. These conditions often manifest with multi-organ involvement, including skeletal abnormalities. The observation that scoliosis is a common feature in many ciliopathy syndromes has led researchers to investigate whether idiopathic scoliosis might represent a milder form of ciliary dysfunction [10, 11].

### 1.2 Cilia Types and Functions

Two main types of cilia are relevant to scoliosis pathogenesis:

1. **Primary cilia**: Non-motile sensory organelles that function as cellular antennae, detecting mechanical and chemical signals
2. **Motile cilia**: Beating organelles that generate fluid flow, particularly important in the central nervous system

Both types share common structural components and regulatory mechanisms, and defects in either can contribute to spinal deformity.

## 2. Genes Implicated in Both Idiopathic Scoliosis and Cilia Function

Multiple genes identified in IS patients are known to play roles in ciliary structure or signaling. Table 1 summarizes key examples, including POC5, KIF7, and TTLL11 which were first discovered via rare variant analyses in IS and later shown to affect cilia. In fact, a large-scale exome study of IS families found an enrichment of rare variants in ciliary, cytoskeletal, and extracellular matrix genes [12], supporting the idea that IS involves polygenic contributions across these pathways. A separate analysis noted that the majority of confirmed IS-associated genes encode proteins connected to cilia structure or function, and numerous cilia-related genes cause scoliosis phenotypes when disrupted in animal models [13]. These findings cement the link between ciliary biology and scoliosis at the genetic level.

### Table 1 – Examples of genes with dual roles in idiopathic scoliosis and ciliary biology

| Gene | Ciliary Role/Pathway | Evidence in Idiopathic Scoliosis (IS) |
|------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **POC5** | Centriolar protein (centrosome component required for primary cilium assembly) [14]. | Rare missense variants (e.g. p.A446T, p.A429V) identified in multiplex IS families [15]. POC5-variant osteoblasts show shortened or "retracted" primary cilia in vitro [16]. In a zebrafish model, expression of human POC5 mutant mRNAs induced axial skeletal curvature reminiscent of IS [17, 18]. |
| **KIF7** | Kinesin motor protein localized to the primary cilium, a regulator of Sonic Hedgehog (Hh) signaling (controls GLI transcription factor processing) [19]. | Whole-exome sequencing in an IS family found a rare KIF7 variant co-segregating with scoliosis [20]; additional severe KIF7 mutations were found in unrelated IS cases [21]. A CRISPR-generated zebrafish kif7^−/− displayed progressive spinal curvatures in juveniles and adults [22]. Despite intact motile cilia and Reissner fiber, mutant fish showed altered Hh pathway gene expression, implicating Hedgehog signaling defects in IS pathogenesis [23]. |
| **TTLL11** | Tubulin polyglutamylase enzyme (adds polyglutamate chains to axonemal microtubules, affecting ciliary structure and stability). | Linkage analysis in a 5-generation IS family mapped to 9q31 and identified a frameshift insertion in TTLL11 as the causal mutation [24]. Two other rare TTLL11 mutations were found in sporadic AIS cases [25]. Patient fibroblasts carrying the mutation had fewer, shorter primary cilia with reduced polyglutamylated tubulin [26]. In zebrafish, ttll11 knockdown or expression of mutant TTLL11 led to defective ciliary function (in retina) and curved body axis, confirming a role in spine development [27]. |
| **CCDC57** | Coiled-coil protein at the ciliary basal body, required for planar polarization of multi-ciliated ependymal cells. | Though not yet found mutated in human AIS, zebrafish ccdc57 mutants provide a mechanistic model: mutants develop late-onset scoliosis during adolescence [28]. The cause is disorganized ependymal cilia beating and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow defects due to misoriented basal bodies [29]. Ccdc57 disruption also alters Urotensin neuropeptide signaling along the spinal cord, and AIS patients were found to have abnormal Urotensin signaling in paraspinal tissues [30], suggesting conserved relevance to human scoliosis. |

### 2.1 Additional Cilia-Related Genes in IS

Other genes and loci linked to IS further underscore ciliary connections. For example, the chromatin remodeler CHD7 (implicated in some IS cases and in CHARGE syndrome) has been associated with cilia-related developmental processes [31]. A rare variant in VANGL1 (a planar cell polarity gene that influences cilia orientation) was reported in an AIS case [32]. Common variant association studies (GWAS) have identified loci in genes such as GPR126 (ADGRG6) and LBX1, which primarily affect connective or musculoskeletal development, but the strongest rare-variant findings to date (e.g. POC5, KIF7, TTLL11) all point to ciliary biology [33, 34]. These genetic insights motivate detailed examination of cilia-related pathways in scoliosis.

## 3. Pathways Linking Ciliary Dysfunction to Scoliosis

Several biological pathways centered on cilia have been implicated in the pathogenesis of idiopathic scoliosis:

### 3.1 Hedgehog Signaling

The Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway is transduced by primary cilia in vertebrate cells. KIF7, a ciliary kinesin, normally constrains GLI transcription factors at the ciliary tip to modulate Hh signaling. Defects in KIF7 lead to dysregulated Hh activity [35]. In spine development, Hedgehog signaling is crucial for patterning the vertebrae and intervertebral discs. The discovery of KIF7 mutations in IS and the corresponding zebrafish mutant's scoliosis indicate that subtle Hh pathway impairments can cause spinal curvature without overt malformations [36]. Notably, kif7 mutant fish had normal motile cilia and Reissner fiber, isolating the effect to Hh signaling changes [37]. This suggests an Hh-dependent mechanism in some IS patients, wherein altered ciliary Hh signaling in growth plate cartilage or spinal tissues leads to asymmetric growth and curvature.

**Mechanism:** Primary cilia serve as platforms for Hedgehog signal transduction. When ciliary function is compromised, GLI transcription factors are not properly processed, leading to dysregulated target gene expression that affects vertebral development and growth plate function.

### 3.2 Cerebrospinal Fluid Flow and Motile Cilia

Proper CSF flow in the central canal of the spinal cord appears to be critical for maintaining a straight spine. Motile cilia on ependymal cells lining the ventricles and central canal generate directional CSF flow. Research in zebrafish by Grimes et al. demonstrated that ptk7 mutant fish (a model of idiopathic scoliosis) have defective ependymal motile cilia and reduced CSF flow, resulting in pronounced spinal curves [38]. Remarkably, restoring motile cilia function in these mutants (via transgenic expression of ptk7 specifically in ciliated cells) prevented scoliosis [39]. Furthermore, mutations in multiple independent cilia motility genes (in zebrafish and medaka fish) all produced scoliosis phenotypes [40, 41]. These findings implicate cilia-driven CSF flow as a key factor in spine straightness.

**Mechanism:** Disrupted CSF flow alters the distribution of growth cues or causes neuroinflammation in the developing spinal cord, leading to curvature. The Reissner fiber (an assembly of SCO-spondin glycoprotein that runs through the CSF) physically interacts with cilia and sensory neurons, and its loss leads to scoliosis in zebrafish [42, 43]. Ciliary function is required for Reissner fiber assembly and tension.

### 3.3 Centrosome and Centriole Cohesion

The centrosome is the base from which the primary cilium is nucleated in interphase cells. Centrosomal proteins ensure proper cilia assembly and cell cycle control. POC5 encodes a centriolar protein important for centriole elongation and maturation [44]. In cells from IS patients with POC5 mutations, POC5 was mislocalized and cells exhibited "ciliary retraction" (shorter cilia) along with abnormal centrosome protein interactions [45, 46]. These defects may disturb the signaling function of primary cilia.

**Mechanism:** Centrosomal/ciliary dysfunction in spinal osteoblasts or chondrocytes could alter their polarity or response to mechanical stimuli, contributing to spine curvature. Indeed, inducing the human POC5^A429V mutation in cultured osteoblasts led to cell cycle delays and destabilized cilia, supporting a centrosome-driven cellular mechanism for IS [47, 48].

### 3.4 Microtubule Post-Translational Modifications

The stability and signaling capacity of cilia are modulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) of axonemal microtubules. One such PTM is polyglutamylation, catalyzed by TTLL (tubulin–tyrosine ligase-like) enzymes. Polyglutamate side chains on microtubules are required for proper intraflagellar transport and ciliary beating. In cells from individuals with TTLL11 mutations, ciliary polyglutamylation is markedly reduced, and the cilia are both fewer in number and shorter [49, 50].

**Mechanism:** Polyglutamylation defects can cause brittle or dysfunctional cilia. In ttll11-deficient zebrafish, shortening of photoreceptor cilia and spinal curvature were observed [51]. This suggests that microtubule modification pathways are involved in maintaining ciliary structure in spinal tissues; disruptions might subtly affect ciliary signaling (e.g. mechanoception or Wnt signaling) and lead to deformity.

### 3.5 Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) Signaling

While technically distinct from ciliary signaling, the PCP pathway intersects with cilia in coordinating cell orientation within tissues. Ependymal cells have their multiple motile cilia aligned by PCP cues. The ccdc57 mutant study showed that loss of a basal body protein disrupts planar polarization of cilia (basal bodies mispositioned), leading to uncoordinated beating [52]. This can be viewed as a convergence of PCP and ciliary dysfunction.

**Mechanism:** Defective planar polarity of ciliated cells in the spine (whether in cartilage endplates or ependyma) could create asymmetries that precipitate a curve. PCP signaling also affects embryonic axis formation; thus, mild PCP alterations might subtly skew spinal growth without causing gross neural tube defects.

### 3.6 Integration of Pathways

Overall, these pathways illustrate that both primary cilia (signaling hubs) and motile cilia (fluid flow generators) are relevant to scoliosis. It is likely that idiopathic scoliosis is genetically heterogeneous, with some patients' curves arising from ciliary signal transduction errors (e.g. Hedgehog or mechano-sensing in bone), and others from cilia motility issues (leading to CSF flow/neurosecretory disturbances). These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and may interact; for example, improper Hh signaling could alter vertebral growth plates, while concurrent CSF flow stasis could affect spinal cord development – together tipping the spine into deformity.

## 4. Experimental Validation in Model Organisms

Animal models have been invaluable for demonstrating that ciliary gene defects can cause scoliosis-like phenotypes. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) in particular has emerged as a powerful system to study idiopathic-type scoliosis because fish can develop spinal curvatures in the absence of bony malformations, mimicking human IS [53]. Moreover, zebrafish cilia and spine development share many features with mammals, and dozens of mutants with cilia dysfunction have been analyzed.

### 4.1 Zebrafish Models

#### POC5 Validation
In the case of POC5, the zebrafish experiments were pivotal. Injection of mRNAs encoding human POC5 variants (found in IS patients) induced a dose-dependent scoliosis in fish without affecting other organs [54, 55]. Control fish injected with wild-type POC5 mRNA stayed straight, and a gene-knockdown of fish poc5 also caused curvature that could be rescued by co-injection of wild-type human POC5 (but not mutant POC5) [56, 57]. These rescue experiments confirmed the variant's pathogenic effect on the spine. Notably, micro-CT imaging of adult zebrafish with mutant POC5 revealed a helical twist of the vertebral column (rotational deformity) akin to human scoliosis [58, 59]. This phenotypic convergence strongly supported POC5 as an IS-causative gene [60, 61].

#### KIF7 Validation
Similarly, for KIF7, a zebrafish CRISPR knockout model (kif7^co63/co63) was used to test its role in axial skeletal integrity. Homozygous kif7 mutants appeared normal at hatch but gradually developed lateral spinal curvatures during juvenile growth, progressing in severity with age [62]. There were no malformations of other ciliated organs (brain ventricles, etc.), separating kif7 scoliosis from typical ciliopathy syndromes [63]. Analysis of these mutants showed that Hedgehog target genes were dysregulated in the spine, aligning with the known function of KIF7 in ciliary Hh signaling [64]. This in vivo validation indicates that KIF7 mutations can indeed drive a late-onset scoliosis, consistent with the human AIS presentation.

#### Motile Cilia Models
Beyond deliberately engineered mutations, unbiased mutant screens in fish have uncovered cilia-related scoliosis models. The ptk7 mutant (originally identified in a forward-genetic screen) develops a pronounced trunk curvature in the absence of vertebral anomalies [65]. Subsequent research showed ptk7 mutants have ependymal cilia defects and CSF flow disruption, as described earlier [66]. Importantly, expressing ptk7 specifically in motile cilia cells rescued the hydrocephalus and prevented the scoliosis, proving that the scoliosis was attributable to ciliary motility dysfunction [67]. Moreover, other zebrafish mutants lacking motile cilia function (for example, mutations in genes encoding dynein arm components of cilia) likewise exhibit spinal curvatures [68]. These include classic primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) gene homologs – when knocked down or mutated in fish, many cause a syndrome of hydrocephalus, body curvature, and sometime situs inversus [69, 70]. Medaka fish (Oryzias) mutants with ciliary defects also show a "wavy" body phenotype (lordokyphosis) with left-right bending of the axis [71]. Thus, across species, motile cilia loss-of-function is sufficient to produce scoliosis, supporting a causal relationship.

#### CCDC57 Model
Newer zebrafish models have illuminated how subtle cilia-related cell biology changes can trigger spine curves. The ccdc57 mutant (PLOS Biol 2023) is a striking example: mutants start to develop scoliosis around 3 weeks of age (analogous to adolescent onset) with no prior embryonic axis defects [72]. Investigators found that even before the curvature became visible, these fish had ependyma polarity defects – their multiciliated ependymal cells had misaligned basal bodies, leading to discoordinated ciliary beating and sluggish CSF flow [73]. This preceded an increase in Urotensin peptide expression in the spinal cord and the eventual lateral bending of the spine [74]. Remarkably, when muscle biopsies from human AIS patients were examined, they too showed elevated expression of Urotensin neuropeptides, hinting that a similar pathway might be active in human scoliosis [75]. The ccdc57 study therefore provides a model wherein impaired planar organization of motile cilia leads to altered fluid flow and neurochemical signaling, ultimately causing scoliosis.

### 4.2 Mouse Models

It should be noted that mouse models of cilia gene defects often show perinatal lethality or severe malformations, making them less straightforward for idiopathic scoliosis research. However, milder mouse mutants do exist. For instance, hypomorphic mutations in IFT88 (intraflagellar transport protein) cause a condition called cobblestone mice which survive to adulthood with skeletal abnormalities, though reports of true scoliosis are limited. One study observed that about 10% of conditional ciliary-gene knockout mice (combining several lines) developed spinal curves, suggesting mice can manifest scoliosis if cilia are disrupted in certain tissues or time windows [76]. Additionally, "meningocele-free" spinal mutants and surgically induced bipedal mouse models have indicated that altered vestibular or proprioceptive inputs (possibly related to ciliary function in inner ear or spine) can contribute to scoliosis [77, 78]. While mice have not yet yielded a cilia-based IS model as clean as zebrafish, they remain useful for targeted tests (e.g. examining Poc5 or Kif7 heterozygous knockouts for mild phenotypes, or measuring cilia in osteoblasts from scoliosis-prone mouse strains).

### 4.3 Summary of Model Organism Studies

In summary, diverse model systems – zebrafish, medaka, and to a lesser extent mice – all support the hypothesis that perturbations in ciliary structure or function can lead to the development of scoliosis. These experiments lend credence to the genetic findings in humans, moving us closer to a causal understanding. They also provide in vivo platforms for testing interventions (for example, drugs that improve cilia motility or mimic downstream signals) which could eventually translate into therapies for IS.

## 5. Computational Network and Pathway Analyses

Recent systems biology approaches have reinforced the connection between scoliosis genes and ciliary pathways. In one study, researchers compiled known IS-associated genes (from human GWAS, family studies, and animal models) and examined their functional relationships. Strikingly, they found that most of these genes converged on ciliary and cytoskeletal functions, forming an interaction network centered around cell structure and cilia-driven signaling [79]. They also noted that scoliosis is frequently observed in human ciliopathies and that many ciliary gene knockdowns in animals cause spinal curves, as described above [80]. This provided a theoretical framework that IS might result from polygenic hits on a "cilia–cytoskeleton network" maintaining spine alignment.

### 5.1 Gene Set Enrichment Analyses

Gene set enrichment analyses on large sequencing datasets have yielded consistent signals. A pilot exome sequencing of 5 AIS families revealed an overrepresentation of rare damaging variants in genes related to cilia and the cytoskeleton (as well as extracellular matrix) [81]. This trend held when exomes of 23 multigenerational families were aggregated: although no single gene was common to all families (underscoring heterogeneity), pathways involving microtubule dynamics, ciliary structure, and extracellular matrix were statistically enriched among the candidate variants [82, 83]. These results suggest that while each family might have its own unique mutation combination, those mutations tend to hit a finite number of biological processes – ciliary function being a prominent one.

### 5.2 Protein-Protein Interaction Networks

Network analysis tools have also highlighted specific hubs. For instance, a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network built from scoliosis-linked genes showed clusters around motile cilia components (e.g. dynein arm proteins DNAH5, DNAI1/2) and around developmental signaling nodes [84]. Some of these same nodes (like TNF and BMP2, which appeared in a PPI of a related spinal condition [85]) could interact with ciliary biology indirectly via inflammation and mechanotransduction. Another integrative study (Oliazadeh et al., 2017) performed a SNP-set association test (SKAT-O) on exome data and initially expected to find a cilia gene burden in AIS patients. Interestingly, that specific test did not show a significant cilia gene enrichment, but it did show enrichment for genes involved in mechanotransduction [86]. The authors interpreted this as possibly downstream of cilia – i.e., the primary cilium's role in mechanotransduction could implicate other mechanosensory proteins in IS if the cilium is defective [87]. In support of this, they found that osteoblasts from AIS patients had abnormal responses to mechanical stimulation in culture, alongside their elongated cilia [88, 89]. Thus, by combining -omics data with cellular assays, a picture emerges where cilia-related mechanosensing pathways are central.

### 5.3 Pathway Mapping

Finally, pathway mapping efforts (like those in the new npj Genomic Medicine whole-genome study [90]) have placed cilia genes in context with other pathways. In that 2025 study, known AIS genes were categorized: among the top tier were POC5 and KIF7 (ciliary), CHD7 (chromatin, but also developmental and possibly ciliary), FBN1/2 (matrix), and LBX1 (muscle lineage) [91]. The authors noted multiple biological pathways implicated, including Hedgehog signaling and extracellular matrix, and recommended a multi-pathway view of AIS etiology. Nonetheless, they cited KIF7 and POC5 as "strong evidence" AIS genes [92], reflecting the growing consensus of ciliary involvement.

### 5.4 Summary of Computational Analyses

In summary, computational analyses of genetic data consistently highlight cilia or closely related systems in idiopathic scoliosis. These approaches complement the single-gene studies and animal models, giving us confidence that the link is genuine and not a coincidental byproduct of other developmental processes. The challenge moving forward is to refine these networks to pinpoint key driver nodes and interactions – for example, is there a master regulator of cilia biogenesis or function that is frequently altered in IS? Ongoing analyses of whole-genome sequencing data, larger cohorts, and integrative network models should further clarify how ciliary biology interfaces with other known factors (like bone density, neuromuscular control, etc.) in scoliosis.

## 6. Proposed Experimental Assays to Validate and Explore Ciliary Genes in Scoliosis

Given the insights above, future research can adopt targeted wet-lab assays to verify the role of candidate genes and dissect their mechanisms. For any gene suspected to link cilia and scoliosis, the following approaches are recommended:

### 6.1 Cilia Morphology and Motility Assays

If the gene is thought to affect cilia structure (e.g. a centriole protein or IFT motor), researchers should examine cilia in patient-derived cells or engineered cell lines. Immunofluorescence staining for ciliary markers such as acetylated α-tubulin (axoneme), ARL13B (ciliary membrane), or polyglutamylated tubulin can reveal abnormalities in cilium length, number, or composition [93, 94]. For example, fibroblasts from an IS patient with a novel gene variant can be cultured under ciliogenesis conditions (serum starvation) and then stained to measure ciliary length distribution and the presence of key proteins. Any deviation (shorter or longer cilia, mislocalized proteins) would support a ciliary defect.

If the candidate is related to motile cilia (like DNAH or CCDC family genes), high-speed video microscopy should be used to assess ciliary beating in relevant tissues. Respiratory epithelial cells or ependymal cell cultures (which are multiciliated) can be obtained from a model organism or induced from human stem cells carrying the mutation. One can measure ciliary beat frequency and coordination and compare to wild-type. Disorganized or slow beating, or immotility, would confirm a functional impact. For instance, a candidate gene knockout in mice could involve recording ependymal cilia motility ex vivo from brain slices and quantifying the beat frequency. Such assays were crucial in the ccdc57 zebrafish study, where they found uncoordinated beating of ependymal cilia using videography [95].

### 6.2 CSF Flow and Reissner Fiber Imaging

To connect ciliary motility defects with functional outcomes, in vivo CSF flow imaging is extremely informative. In zebrafish, this can be done by injecting fluorescent microspheres or tracers into the brain ventricles and performing live imaging of their movement down the spinal canal [96]. Comparing particle flow speed and trajectories between wild-type and cilia-mutant fish quantifies the degree of CSF stagnation [97]. As demonstrated in the ptk7 mutant, such an assay showed that flow was almost absent without motile cilia, and was restored upon rescue [98, 99]. Researchers can also visualize the Reissner fiber in live zebrafish by using transgenic lines expressing a tagged SCO-spondin protein [100]. This allows observation of fiber formation and integrity in mutants: e.g., does the fiber break up or fail to form when a candidate gene is knocked out? In a recent study, loss of the Reissner fiber was correlated with scoliosis and could be rescued by genetic interventions, validating it as a readout [101]. For mammalian models, MRI or ultrasound-based CSF flow measurements could be explored in mutant mice (though resolution is challenging in small animals). Alternatively, histological analysis of Reissner fiber presence in fixed tissues (with antibodies against SCO-spondin) could be done for mutant vs. control.

### 6.3 Zebrafish CRISPR and Transgenic Models

The speed and scalability of zebrafish make them ideal for in vivo validation of new scoliosis candidate genes. For any novel gene (say identified by genome sequencing of AIS patients), one can create a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout zebrafish or use morpholino antisense knockdown to assess spinal phenotypes in larvae and juveniles. If the fish develop a curved body axis (and especially if no other major malformations appear), it provides strong evidence linking that gene to idiopathic-type scoliosis. This approach was used successfully for KIF7 and TTLL11 (producing curved fish that echoed patient phenotypes) [102, 103].

Moreover, zebrafish allow tissue-specific manipulation: using promoters like foxj1a (motile cilia cells) or col2a1 (cartilage), one can drive expression of wild-type gene in a mutant background to see if it rescues the curve. Conversely, expressing a dominant-negative or human mutant version of the gene in wild-type fish can test if it induces scoliosis, as done with POC5 variants [104, 105]. These gain- and loss-of-function experiments will clarify the gene's role. Additionally, fish models enable high-throughput drug screening: for example, if a cilia-associated pathway (like Hh or inflammation) is suspected, one can treat mutant larvae with modulators (Hh agonists/antagonists, anti-inflammatory drugs) to see if spinal alignment improves. This could identify therapeutic leads applicable to human patients.

### 6.4 Mouse and Cell Culture Functional Assays

For genes where rodent biology is relevant (e.g. genes affecting skeletal or neuromuscular system), creating a conditional knockout mouse in the cell type of interest (osteoblasts, chondrocytes, ependymal cells, etc.) can verify the phenotype. While a full knockout of an essential cilia gene can cause severe defects, a tissue-specific knockout might result in a milder phenotype such as late-onset scoliosis in otherwise healthy mice. These mice can then be used to study detailed pathological changes: Is there asymmetrical growth at the growth plates? Are there signs of local inflammation or altered gene expression in the paraspinal muscles or spinal cord?

Additionally, ex vivo culture of cells from these mice provides a platform for mechanistic assays. For example, osteoblasts from an IS gene knockout mouse can be grown in a bioreactor that applies cyclic stretch or fluid shear, to test if they have abnormal mechanotransduction responses (e.g. altered ERK activation or osteogenic gene expression in response to load). This follows the example of the 2017 study which found differential expression of mechanosensitive genes in IS patient osteoblasts under mechanical strain [106, 107]. If the knockout cells show a similar blunted or exaggerated response, it indicates the gene's role in that mechanosensory pathway, possibly via cilia.

### 6.5 Molecular Pathway Assays

To connect genotype to phenotype, specific molecular readouts are useful. For Hedgehog-pathway genes (like KIF7 or if a patient variant in SMO, GLI etc. were found), one can perform Gli luciferase reporter assays in cells with and without the mutation to see if Hh signaling is hyper- or hypo-active. Similarly, for genes potentially affecting Wnt/planar cell polarity, one could examine CE (convergent extension) defects in zebrafish embryos (a standard readout for PCP disruptions) or cell polarity readouts in cultured cells. If a candidate is suspected to affect inflammation or neuropeptide signaling secondarily (like CCDC57 did with Urotensin), measuring those factors in model organisms or patient cerebrospinal fluid might be enlightening. For example, one could check CSF or serum of scoliosis patients for inflammatory cytokines or peptides that correspond to the pathways implicated by cilia models (e.g. Urotensin II, IL-6, etc.). Any concordance would strengthen the pathogenic link. This sort of assay helps distinguish whether the gene's effect is cell-autonomous (within the ciliated cell) or non-autonomous (through secreted factors).

### 6.6 Control and Rescue Experiments

In all such experiments, it's crucial to use controls and, where possible, rescue experiments to demonstrate specificity. For instance, if knocking down a gene in zebrafish causes a curve, adding back a wild-type human gene should rescue, whereas adding back a mutant human gene may fail to rescue – recapitulating the disease variant's inability to function. This was elegantly shown for POC5, where wild-type POC5 mRNA rescued the morphant fish, but AIS-mutant POC5 mRNA did not [108, 109]. Likewise, for a cell-based ciliary defect, re-expression of the correct gene should normalize cilia length or beating if the phenotype is truly due to loss of that gene's function. Co-localization studies can also be informative: for example, does the candidate protein localize to the cilium or basal body in cells? Many cilia genes (even novel ones) will show a ciliary localization when tagged, confirming they directly operate in that organelle.

### 6.7 Clinical Correlation

Finally, collaboration between laboratory science and clinical observation is important. Any assays with patient cells (fibroblasts, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived osteoblasts, etc.) should be correlated with clinical data (curve severity, progression rate, etc.). It could turn out that patients with cilia-related gene mutations form a subset with particular traits (e.g. severe rotation or neurologic signs). Identifying such patterns may guide what assays are most relevant for predicting disease course or treatment responses. For example, if a patient's cells show drastically reduced cilia motility, perhaps that indicates a risk of rapid curve progression due to ongoing CSF flow issues – suggesting they might benefit from early intervention.

### 6.8 Summary of Experimental Approaches

In conclusion, a multifaceted experimental approach – spanning cell biology, animal modeling, and biophysical measurements – is poised to validate candidate genes and unravel the cilia–scoliosis connection. Prioritizing genes that consistently emerge in human genetic studies (like POC5, KIF7, TTLL11, and others) and testing them in these assays will steadily build the evidence base. This not only confirms causality but also helps answer how ciliary defects translate to a curved spine, ultimately pointing toward targeted therapies (e.g. drugs that enhance ciliary function or compensate for the disrupted pathway) for idiopathic scoliosis.

## 7. Clinical Implications and Therapeutic Opportunities

### 7.1 Risk Stratification

The identification of cilia-related genes in IS opens new possibilities for risk stratification. Patients with mutations in key ciliary genes (POC5, KIF7, TTLL11) may represent a distinct subgroup with specific clinical characteristics. Future studies should investigate whether these patients have:

- Different curve progression patterns
- Unique response to bracing or surgical intervention
- Associated non-spinal features (e.g., subtle ciliopathy symptoms)
- Family history patterns consistent with Mendelian inheritance

### 7.2 Therapeutic Targets

The cilia-scoliosis connection suggests several potential therapeutic approaches:

#### 7.2.1 Hedgehog Pathway Modulation
For patients with KIF7 or other Hedgehog pathway mutations, targeted modulation of Hh signaling could be beneficial. This might include:
- Small molecule Hh agonists or antagonists
- Gene therapy approaches to restore normal KIF7 function
- Pharmacological agents that enhance ciliary Hh signal transduction

#### 7.2.2 CSF Flow Enhancement
For patients with motile cilia dysfunction, improving CSF flow could be therapeutic:
- Pharmacological agents that enhance ciliary motility
- Physical therapies that promote CSF circulation
- Surgical interventions to improve CSF dynamics

#### 7.2.3 Centrosome Function Restoration
For patients with centrosome-related mutations (e.g., POC5), approaches to restore normal centrosome function could be explored:
- Small molecules that stabilize centrosome structure
- Gene therapy to restore normal POC5 function
- Cellular therapies using corrected patient-derived cells

### 7.3 Personalized Medicine Approaches

The genetic heterogeneity of IS suggests that personalized treatment approaches may be most effective. Patients could be stratified based on their underlying genetic defect:

- **Hedgehog pathway defects**: Hh modulation therapies
- **Motile cilia dysfunction**: CSF flow enhancement
- **Centrosome defects**: Centrosome stabilization
- **Microtubule modification defects**: Tubulin modification restoration

### 7.4 Biomarker Development

Cilia-related biomarkers could be developed for:
- Early detection of IS risk
- Monitoring disease progression
- Assessing treatment response
- Predicting surgical outcomes

Potential biomarkers include:
- CSF flow velocity measurements
- Ciliary beat frequency in patient cells
- Hedgehog pathway activity markers

## 9. Conclusions

The convergence of genetic, computational, and experimental evidence strongly supports ciliary dysfunction as a major contributor to idiopathic scoliosis pathogenesis. Key findings include:

1. **Genetic evidence**: Multiple genes with ciliary functions (POC5, KIF7, TTLL11, CCDC57) are implicated in IS through rare variant analyses and family studies.

2. **Mechanistic pathways**: Several cilia-related pathways contribute to scoliosis, including Hedgehog signaling, cerebrospinal fluid flow, centrosome function, microtubule modifications, and planar cell polarity.

3. **Animal models**: Zebrafish and other model organisms demonstrate that ciliary dysfunction can cause scoliosis-like phenotypes, providing strong evidence for causality.

4. **Computational analyses**: Network and pathway analyses consistently highlight ciliary and cytoskeletal functions in IS-associated genes.

5. **Therapeutic opportunities**: The identification of cilia-related mechanisms opens new possibilities for targeted therapies and personalized medicine approaches.

The cilia-scoliosis connection represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of idiopathic scoliosis, moving from a purely mechanical view to one that incorporates fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms. This new understanding has the potential to revolutionize both diagnosis and treatment of this common and often debilitating condition.

Future research should focus on:
- Expanding genetic studies to identify additional cilia-related genes
- Developing better model systems for mechanistic studies
- Translating basic science findings into clinical applications
- Creating personalized treatment approaches based on underlying genetic defects

The cilia-scoliosis connection offers hope for more effective treatments and ultimately, prevention of this condition that affects millions of children worldwide.
