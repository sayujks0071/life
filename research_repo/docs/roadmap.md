# Research Roadmap

Current status and future directions for the Biological Counter-Curvature (BCC) project.

## Current Phase: Foundations & Framework

- [x] Initial BCC theory draft.
- [x] Information-Cosserat (IEC) framework implementation in `spinalmodes`.
- [x] Basic AlphaFold structure-to-mechanics mapping.
- [x] Organization of research materials (this repo).

## Next Phase: Validation & Refinement

- [ ] **Run Full Sweeps**: Execute the complete simulation suite across varied gravity and stiffness parameters.
- [ ] **AlphaFold 3 Integration**: Update protein structure analysis with AF3 for better interaction modeling.
- [ ] **Manuscript Completion**: Integrate results from recent experiments into the primary draft.
- [ ] **Peer Review Revisions**: Address points raised in the [Nature Peer Review Report](../research/05_summaries-by-topic/PEER_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md).

## Future Directions

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Training a model to predict $I(s)$ from genomic data.
- **Clinical Pilot**: Applying the IEC framework to analyze patient-specific scoliosis data.
- **Microgravity Adaption**: Modeling the "straightening" effect observed in ISS astronauts.

## Gaps / Open Questions

- What is the precise molecular basis of the Information Field $I(s)$?
- How does feedback gain ($\chi$) vary across different vertebrate species?
