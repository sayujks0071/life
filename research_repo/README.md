# Conscience: Biological Counter-Curvature Research Repository

Welcome to the `conscience` repository. This project focuses on the **Biological Counter-Curvature (BCC)** theory, exploring the interplay between developmental information, mechanical feedback, and spinal geometry.

## Overview

This repository serves as a centralized hub for research materials, analysis code, and documentation related to the BCC theory. We apply Information-Cosserat frameworks to understand how the S-shaped geometry of the spine is maintained against gravitational buckling.

## Navigation

To navigate this repository, start with the following:

- **[Docs Index](docs/index.md)**: Table of contents for all documentation.
- **[Literature Map](docs/literature-map.md)**: Conceptual taxonomy of the research.
- **[Research Timeline](docs/timeline.md)**: Chronological view of findings and publications.
- **[Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md)**: Future directions and open questions.

## Structure

- `research/`: Organized notes and source materials categorized by topic.
- `docs/`: Navigation, indices, and reference metadata.
- `assets/`: Figures, PDFs, and supporting media.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for data processing and figure generation.
- `src/`: Core simulation and analysis code (IEC framework).

## How to Get Started

1. Review the [Research Index](docs/index.md).
2. Explore the [Foundations](research/01_foundations/) to understand the core BCC theory.
3. Check the [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) for current tasks and future experiments.
