"""PyElastica integration layer for countercurvature simulations.

This module will provide factory utilities that construct Cosserat rod systems whose rest
curvature, stiffness and active moments are modulated by information fields.  The design
follows the biological countercurvature hypothesis: information gradients act as local
corrections to the mechanical metric, effectively biasing the rod against gravity-driven
modes.

Implementation pending: the initial repository task focuses on establishing the data
structures and coupling functions upon which this bridge will rely.
