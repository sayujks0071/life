# IEC Project Implementation Summary

**Project:** Spinal Modes - Information-Elasticity Coupling Model  
**Implementation Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** ⚠️ **PROTOTYPE — CORE FRAMEWORK IN PLACE, VALIDATION OUTSTANDING**

> **Important:** This is an early research prototype. Core Python modules, CLI commands, and documentation scaffolding exist, but solvers are simplified, no figures/data have been generated yet, and several deliverables listed below remain aspirational. See `ACTUAL_STATUS.md` for the detailed assessment.

---

## Executive Summary

This repository captures the **conceptual foundation** for the Information‑Elasticity Coupling (IEC) model. The following pieces are implemented today:

- **Core IEC module** (`src/spinalmodes/iec.py`, ~340 lines) with parameter handling, coherence-field generators, and toy beam/dynamic solvers.
- **CLI tooling** (`src/spinalmodes/iec_cli.py`, ~390 lines) offering five subcommands that wire the core routines into demos, sweeps, and figure pipelines.
- **Unit tests** (`tests/test_iec.py`, ~320 lines) verifying field generation, coupling logic, and acceptance-criterion style behaviors using the simplified solver.
- **Documentation skeleton** including README, CLI guide, figure notes, and a draft manuscript (433 lines) with placeholders for affiliations and outstanding results.
- **Figure script** (`src/spinalmodes/fig_iec_discriminators.py`) ready to generate discriminator panels once validated parameters and solvers are in place.

Critical gaps remain: figures/CSVs are not yet generated, CI/CD workflows are absent, solver fidelity is insufficient for publication-grade claims, and several documents overstate completion. The near-term goal is to align messaging with reality and roadmap the remaining work.

## Key Deliverables (Truthful Status)

### 1. Manuscript — **Draft, Needs Completion**
- **File:** `docs/manuscript/SpinalCountercurvature_IEC.md`
- **Current state:** 433 lines covering abstract through discussion; affiliations and some quantitative results are placeholders.
- **Missing:** Referenced figures/data, finalized references, experimental validation discussion tied to actual outputs.

### 2. IEC Model Implementation — **Core Logic Ready, Solver Simplified**
- **File:** `src/spinalmodes/iec.py` (~340 lines).
- **Done:** Coupling definitions (IEC‑1/2/3), coherence fields, helper metrics, toy static/dynamic solvers.
- **To do:** Replace `solve_beam_static` with a robust boundary-value / Cosserat solver, add validation cases, document numerical assumptions.

### 3. CLI Commands — **Implemented, Lightly Tested**
- **File:** `src/spinalmodes/iec_cli.py` (~390 lines).
- **Done:** `demo`, `sweep`, `phase`, `node-drift`, `helical-threshold` commands that emit CSV/JSON/PNG paths.
- **To do:** End-to-end smoke tests, ensure commands generate valid artifacts once solver/figures are trustworthy.

### 4. Figure Generation — **Script Exists, Outputs Missing**
- **File:** `src/spinalmodes/fig_iec_discriminators.py` (~210 lines).
- **Done:** Logic for three-panel discriminator figure; metadata/CSV export scaffolding.
- **To do:** Run with validated parameters, check generated PNG/JSON/CSV into `outputs/`, confirm visual quality, update manuscript references.

### 5. Tests — **Unit Coverage Good, Acceptance Metrics Prototype**
- **File:** `tests/test_iec.py` (~320 lines, 15+ tests).
- **Done:** Field mode checks, coupling mechanics, acceptance-style assertions using toy solver, utility coverage.
- **To do:** Add regression tests once solvers upgraded; unskip CLI smoke tests when environment stable.

### 6. Documentation — **Structure in Place, Messaging Needs Alignment**
- **Files:** `README.md`, `docs/cli.md`, `docs/figures.md`, `SETUP_AND_EXECUTION.md`, etc.
- **Done:** Comprehensive structure, instructions, and conceptual descriptions.
- **To do:** Update sections that promise production readiness, ensure setup instructions reflect current dependency status, inject prototype disclaimers (in progress via this edit).

### 7. Validation & Tooling — **Available but Untested**
- **File:** `tools/validate_figures.py` (≈150 lines) ready to check figure specs.
- **Status:** Not yet exercised because figures have not been generated; integrate into future CI/QA workflow.

### 8. CI/CD Pipeline — **Not Present**
- No `.github/workflows/*.yml` files are currently committed (previous attempts blocked by token scope).
- Action item: recreate minimal lint/test workflow directly in GitHub once permissions sorted.

---

## Snapshot Metrics

- **Python LOC (src/ + tests/ + tools/):** ~1,466 (via `cloc`).
- **Tests:** 15 passing unit tests (requires local `pytest` run; not automated yet).
- **Outputs:** `outputs/` directories contain only `.gitkeep` placeholders; no CSV/PNG/JSON artifacts generated.
- **Documentation:** Draft manuscript (433 lines), supporting docs (~10 files), GitHub Pages site scaffolded.

---

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Documentation honesty:** Ensure all public-facing docs mirror the prototype status (this file, `VERIFICATION_LOG.md`, `DELIVERABLES_CHECKLIST.md`).
2. **Solver upgrade:** Prioritize replacing `solve_beam_static` with a validated solver and add numerical tests.
3. **Generate exemplar outputs:** Produce at least one end-to-end run of each CLI command to populate `outputs/` and feed manuscript figures.
4. **Reintroduce CI:** Add a lightweight GitHub Actions workflow for lint + unit tests once solver stability improves.
5. **Finalize manuscript front matter:** Fill in affiliations/contact info and caveats about current computational maturity.

## Working Notes

- **Execution:** Use `poetry run pytest` and `poetry run spinalmodes …` once dependencies are installed; expect outputs to land in `outputs/` (currently empty).
- **Quality checks:** Until CI is restored, manually run `make format`, `make lint`, `make typecheck`, and `make test`.
- **Reporting:** Update `VERIFICATION_LOG.md` and `DELIVERABLES_CHECKLIST.md` whenever new outputs, solver upgrades, or documentation changes land to keep the public story accurate.
