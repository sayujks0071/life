"""Countercurvature experiment scripts.

This package contains reproducible experiments demonstrating biological
countercurvature of spacetime using information-driven Cosserat rod mechanics.

Experiments:
- experiment_plant_upward_growth: Plant stem growing against gravity
- experiment_spine_modes_vs_gravity: Spinal curvature modes with information coupling
- experiment_microgravity_adaptation: Shape preservation in reduced gravity
