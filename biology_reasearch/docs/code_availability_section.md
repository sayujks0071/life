# Code and Data Availability Section

## Draft for Manuscript

### Code Availability

All simulations and metrics were implemented in the open-source `spinalmodes` package (version 0.1.0), available at [GitHub URL]. The package provides a Python API for Information-Elasticity Coupling (IEC) models, countercurvature metrics, and Cosserat rod simulations. Key functions used in this work include:

- `compute_countercurvature_metric`: Computes the biological countercurvature metric g_eff(s) from information fields
- `geodesic_curvature_deviation`: Measures information-driven deviations from gravity-selected curvature
- `compute_scoliosis_metrics`: Computes lateral scoliosis index (S_lat) and Cobb-like angles from centerline coordinates
- `CounterCurvatureRodSystem`: PyElastica-based Cosserat rod system with information-driven countercurvature

The codebase includes reproducible experiment scripts for phase diagrams, microgravity adaptation, scoliosis bifurcation, and plant-like growth, all available in `src/spinalmodes/experiments/countercurvature/`. Installation instructions, API documentation, and example notebooks are provided in the repository.

### Data Availability

All simulation outputs, phase diagrams, and figure data are saved in structured CSV format under `outputs/experiments/` and `outputs/csv/`. The following datasets are available:

- **Phase diagram data**: `outputs/experiments/phase_diagram/phase_diagram_data.csv`
  - Contains D_geo_norm, S_lat, Cobb-like angles for all (χ_κ, g) combinations
  - Includes symmetric and asymmetric cases for scoliosis regime detection

- **Spine modes sweep**: `outputs/experiments/spine_modes/spine_modes_results.csv`
  - Contains curvature profiles, centerline coordinates, and metrics for χ_κ sweep
  - Includes I(s) and dIds fields for figure generation

- **Microgravity adaptation**: `outputs/experiments/microgravity/microgravity_summary.csv`
  - Contains D_geo_norm and passive energy for gravity range 1.0 → 0.01

- **Scoliosis bifurcation**: `outputs/experiments/scoliosis_bifurcation/scoliosis_bifurcation_data.csv`
  - Contains S_lat, Cobb-like angles, and amplification factors for (χ_κ, ε_asym) sweeps

All data files are generated by running the corresponding experiment scripts (see `run_experiments.sh` or individual `experiment_*.py` files). The data format is documented in the repository, and all scripts include `--quick` flags for fast exploratory runs.

**Data repository**: [GitHub URL]/outputs  
**Format**: CSV (pandas-compatible)  
**Reproducibility**: All experiments use fixed random seeds and documented parameter ranges

\section*{Code Availability}

All simulations and metrics were implemented in the open-source \texttt{spinalmodes} package (version 0.1.0), available at \url{[GitHub URL]}. The package provides a Python API for Information--Elasticity Coupling (IEC) models, countercurvature metrics, and Cosserat rod simulations. Key functions used in this work include: \texttt{compute\_countercurvature\_metric} (computes the biological countercurvature metric $g_{\mathrm{eff}}(s)$ from information fields), \texttt{geodesic\_curvature\_deviation} (measures information-driven deviations from gravity-selected curvature), \texttt{compute\_scoliosis\_metrics} (computes lateral scoliosis index $S_{\mathrm{lat}}$ and Cobb-like angles), and \texttt{CounterCurvatureRodSystem} (PyElastica-based Cosserat rod system with information-driven countercurvature). The codebase includes reproducible experiment scripts for phase diagrams, microgravity adaptation, scoliosis bifurcation, and plant-like growth. Installation instructions, API documentation, and example notebooks are provided in the repository.

\section*{Data Availability}

All simulation outputs, phase diagrams, and figure data are saved in structured CSV format under \texttt{outputs/experiments/} and \texttt{outputs/csv/}. The phase diagram data (\texttt{phase\_diagram\_data.csv}) contains $\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}}$, $S_{\mathrm{lat}}$, and Cobb-like angles for all $(\chi_\kappa, g)$ combinations. Spine modes sweep data (\texttt{spine\_modes\_results.csv}) contains curvature profiles, centerline coordinates, and metrics for $\chi_\kappa$ sweeps, including $I(s)$ and $dI/ds$ fields for figure generation. Microgravity adaptation data (\texttt{microgravity\_summary.csv}) contains $\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}}$ and passive energy for gravity range $1.0 \to 0.01$. Scoliosis bifurcation data (\texttt{scoliosis\_bifurcation\_data.csv}) contains $S_{\mathrm{lat}}$, Cobb-like angles, and amplification factors for $(\chi_\kappa, \varepsilon_{\mathrm{asym}})$ sweeps. All data files are generated by running the corresponding experiment scripts (see \texttt{run\_experiments.sh}). The data format is documented in the repository, and all scripts include \texttt{--quick} flags for fast exploratory runs.
