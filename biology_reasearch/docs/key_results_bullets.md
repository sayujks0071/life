# Key Results: Ultra-Compact Bullet List

## For Use In: Introduction, Significance, Cover Letter, Executive Summary

### Version 1: Technical (for Introduction/Cover Letter)

1. **Unified framework**: Normal sagittal spinal curvature and scoliosis-like lateral deviations emerge from a single Information--Elasticity Coupling (IEC) model operating in different countercurvature regimes.

2. **Quantitative phase diagram**: A Riemannian metric derived from information fields yields a phase diagram in $(\chi_\kappa, g)$ space that cleanly separates gravity-dominated, cooperative, and information-dominated regimes, with $\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}}$ as the order parameter.

3. **Microgravity persistence**: Information-driven structure (quantified by $\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}}$) persists independently of gravitational loading: as $g$ decreases from 1.0 to 0.01, passive curvature energy falls by [X]%, while $\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}}$ changes by only [Y]%.

4. **Scoliosis bifurcation**: In the information-dominated regime, small thoracic asymmetries (5%) are amplified into scoliosis-like branches (Cobb-like angles >10°), while the same perturbation produces negligible deviation in the gravity-dominated regime.

5. **Analog-gravity perspective**: The framework provides a quantitative language for how biological information reshapes equilibrium geometry, treating normal and pathological curvatures as different ``geodesics'' in an information-modified effective spacetime.

### Version 2: Accessible (for Significance/General Audience)

1. **Single framework for normal and pathological curvature**: The same model reproduces normal S-shaped spinal profiles and scoliosis-like lateral deviations, depending on how strongly information processing modifies the effective geometry.

2. **Three distinct regimes**: The framework identifies gravity-dominated, cooperative, and information-dominated regimes, with clear phase boundaries that predict when small asymmetries will be amplified into scoliosis-like patterns.

3. **Information maintains structure in microgravity**: Information-driven structure persists even as gravitational loading is reduced, demonstrating that biological information can maintain body geometry independently of gravity.

4. **Scoliosis as symmetry breaking**: Small thoracic asymmetries (5%) produce negligible lateral deviation in the gravity-dominated regime but are amplified into pronounced scoliosis-like deformations (Cobb-like angles >10°) in the information-dominated regime.

5. **Quantitative predictions**: The framework makes testable predictions for microgravity posture studies, scoliosis progression, and in vivo spinal curvature measurements, bridging theoretical physics and clinical biomechanics.

### Version 3: Ultra-Compact (3 bullets, for Executive Summary)

1. **Unified framework**: Normal sagittal curvature and scoliosis-like lateral deviations emerge from a single IEC--Cosserat model in different countercurvature regimes.

2. **Phase diagram**: A Riemannian metric yields three regimes (gravity-dominated, cooperative, information-dominated) with $\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}}$ as the order parameter; in the information-dominated regime, small asymmetries are amplified into scoliosis-like branches.

3. **Microgravity persistence**: Information-driven structure persists independently of gravitational loading, demonstrating that biological information maintains body geometry when gravity is reduced.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Unified framework}: Normal sagittal spinal curvature and scoliosis-like lateral deviations emerge from a single Information--Elasticity Coupling (IEC) model operating in different countercurvature regimes.
  
  \item \textbf{Quantitative phase diagram}: A Riemannian metric derived from information fields yields a phase diagram in $(\chiK, g)$ space that cleanly separates gravity-dominated, cooperative, and information-dominated regimes, with $\Dgeohat$ as the order parameter.
  
  \item \textbf{Microgravity persistence}: Information-driven structure (quantified by $\Dgeohat$) persists independently of gravitational loading: as $g$ decreases from 1.0 to 0.01, passive curvature energy falls by [X]\%, while $\Dgeohat$ changes by only [Y]\%.
  
  \item \textbf{Scoliosis bifurcation}: In the information-dominated regime, small thoracic asymmetries (5\%) are amplified into scoliosis-like branches (Cobb-like angles $>10\degree$), while the same perturbation produces negligible deviation in the gravity-dominated regime.
  
  \item \textbf{Analog-gravity perspective}: The framework provides a quantitative language for how biological information reshapes equilibrium geometry, treating normal and pathological curvatures as different ``geodesics'' in an information-modified effective spacetime.
