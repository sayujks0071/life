\section*{Code and Data Availability}

All simulations and analyses were performed using the open-source Python package \texttt{spinalmodes} (v0.3.3), available at \url{https://github.com/sayujks0071/life}. The exact codebase and simulation data underlying this study are archived on Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.XXXXX). The computational environment, including dependencies such as \texttt{PyElastica} (v0.3.3) and \texttt{NumPy} (v1.24), is specified in the \texttt{requirements.txt} file included in the repository. All figure data are stored as CSV files and can be fully regenerated by running the experiment scripts in \texttt{src/spinalmodes/experiments/countercurvature/}. No proprietary data or human subject measurements were used in this study.
