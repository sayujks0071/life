## Overview

This repository contains the manuscript, reproducible analysis code, and datasets supporting a theoretical framework that explains how developmental information shapes biological structures against gravity. The work bridges developmental genetics, biomechanics, and differential geometry to understand spinal curvature in normal development, microgravity adaptation, and pathological conditions like scoliosis.

**Key Insight:** Developmental information acts as biological "countercurvature"—modifying the effective spacetime metric experienced by living structures, enabling them to maintain complex geometries against gravitational loading.

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/sayujks0071/life.git
cd life

# Create virtual environment (Python 3.10+ required)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run a Basic Simulation

To run the minimal Elastica experiment utilizing the Counter-Curvature Rod System:

```bash
python scripts/experiments/experiment_minimal_elastica.py
```

### 3. AlphaFold Counter-Curvature Analysis

For protein structure analysis steps, refer to `research/alphafold_countercurvature/README.md` (if available) or explore the module directly.

## Key Results

### 1. S-Curve Emergence
The model demonstrates that the characteristic spinal S-curve emerges as the **energetic ground state** when developmental information (HOX patterning) couples to mechanical properties via the Information-Elasticity Coupling (IEC).

### 2. Phase Diagram
Three distinct regimes identified in the parameter space:
- **Gravity-dominated**: Structure follows passive gravitational geodesics.
- **Cooperative**: Information and gravity balance (normal physiology).
- **Information-dominated**: Strong geometric distortion (potential pathology).

### 3. Microgravity Persistence
Model predicts spinal curvature **persists in microgravity**, identifying a "Stagnant Pool" effect driven by fluid shifts that may drive inflammatory scoliosis.
