## Abstract
Living systems routinely maintain structure against gravity, from plant stems to vertebrate spines. We propose a quantitative framework of **biological countercurvature**, where developmental information modifies the effective geometry experienced by a body in a gravitational field. By coupling an Information--Elasticity (IEC) model to Cosserat rod mechanics, we treat the spine as a geodesic in an effective biological spacetime metric $d\ell_{\mathrm{eff}}^2$. We derive a mode selection principle showing that while gravity alone selects a C-shaped sag, the information-coupled system stabilizes an S-shaped counter-curvature mode. A normalized geodesic deviation metric $\widehat{D}_{\mathrm{geo}}$ quantifies this information-driven reshaping. Phase diagrams reveal distinct regimes: gravity-dominated, cooperative, and information-dominated, where the latter predicts the emergence of scoliosis-like lateral deformities as symmetry-broken modes. This framework unifies normal development and pathology as regimes of a single information-geometric mechanism.
