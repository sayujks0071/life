# Project Verification Log

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Project:** Spinal Modes – IEC Model  
**Status:** ⚠️ Prototype — Verification Incomplete

---

## Overview

This log records what has been confirmed to work and what remains outstanding for the IEC research prototype. The core Python package and documentation scaffolding exist, but solvers, outputs, and automation still require significant work.

---

## Verified Assets

- **Core module (`src/spinalmodes/iec.py`)**: Implements IEC parameter dataclass, four coherence field modes, coupling logic for IEC‑1/2/3, utility helpers, and toy static/dynamic solvers.
- **CLI (`src/spinalmodes/iec_cli.py`)**: Five Typer subcommands (`demo`, `sweep`, `phase`, `node-drift`, `helical-threshold`) wired to the core module.
- **Tests (`tests/test_iec.py`)**: 15+ unit tests cover field generation, coupling logic, acceptance-style behaviors, and utilities. Tests pass locally with the simplified solver.
- **Figure script (`src/spinalmodes/fig_iec_discriminators.py`)**: Generates discriminator panels and writes accompanying CSV/JSON when executed.
- **Documentation**: README, CLI guide, figure notes, and manuscript draft (433 lines) capture the conceptual framework and now reference prototype status.
- **Validation tooling**: `tools/validate_figures.py` is ready to check PNG/CSV outputs for publication specs.

## Outstanding Items

1. **Solver fidelity**  
   Replace `solve_beam_static` with a validated boundary-value or Cosserat solver, benchmark `solve_dynamic_modes`, and revisit acceptance thresholds once accurate dynamics are available.

2. **Generated artifacts**  
   Run each CLI command end-to-end, commit resulting CSV/PNG/JSON outputs under `outputs/`, and record figure validation results.

3. **Manuscript completion**  
   Fill in affiliations/contact info, update sections that reference non-existent figures, and align text with the current computational status.

4. **Automation**  
   Restore GitHub Actions (lint + pytest) once token permissions allow, and document a reliable local workflow (`make format`, `make lint`, `make typecheck`, `make test`).

5. **Documentation hygiene**  
   Continue auditing project docs (README, PROJECT_SUMMARY.md, DELIVERABLES_CHECKLIST.md) to keep claims aligned with reality and link back to `ACTUAL_STATUS.md` for context.

## Suggested Next Verification Steps

1. Install dependencies (Poetry or `pip`) and re-run `pytest` to document exact command/output.  
2. Execute `poetry run spinalmodes iec demo` and confirm CSV/JSON generation.  
3. Produce `fig_iec_discriminators.png` and validate using `tools/validate_figures.py`.  
4. Add a minimal `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with lint/test jobs and monitor the first run.  
5. Update this log with the results, including any failures or new issues discovered.
